MXene, displaying exceptional attributes in conductivity, thermal efficiency, good dispersibility etc., has emerged as a preferred material for high-performance thermal actuators. However, single actuators struggle to achieve complex tasks realized by intelligent robotic systems. Herein, a bioinspired dynamic matrix is presented utilizing the developable structure of MXene-cellulose nanofibers (CNF) soft actuators. The inclusion of CNF considerably bolsters the mechanical properties of MXene. The MXene-CNF film possessed a higher working strain range (≈14%) than pure MXene film (≈2%). The designed developable structures complete the actuating movements. The sensing layer integration with the actuating layer led to an extremely low touch detection limit (0.3 kPa) and expedited actuating-feedback due to the interaction between contact charging and electrostatic induction. A responsive dynamic matrix containing 3 × 3 soft actuators, completed with a close-looped sensing-feedback function, is developed similar to the behavior of the mimosa plant. This mimosa-inspired dynamic matrix is capable of identifying the source of touch stimuli and providing immediate feedback. This research broadens the potential for enhancing adaptability and intelligence of soft robotic system.",

However, this process is sluggish, and even worse, it is a CO2-emitting and carbon resource waste process. Therefore, it is highly urgent to develop a novel strategy for recycling post-consumer PLA to achieve a circular plastic economy. Herein, we report a one-pot photoreforming route for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value-added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Results show the alanine production rate can reach up to 2.4 mmol gcat−1 h−1, with a high selectivity (&gt;75 %) and excellent stability. Time-resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole-dominated PLA oxidation to coproduce alanine.

To achieve efficient BBB crossing and deep GBM penetration, this work demonstrates a strategy of active transcellular transport of a mitochondrion-disturbing nanomedicine, pGBEMA22-b-pSSPPT9 (GBEPPT), in the GBM tissue through mitocytosis. GBEPPT is computer-aided designed and prepared by self-assembling a conjugate of an amphiphilic block polymer and a drug podophyllotoxin (PPT). When GBEPPT is delivered to the tumor site, overexpressed γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) on the brain–blood endothelial cell, or the GBM cell triggered enzymatic hydrolysis of γ-glutamylamide on GBEPPT to reverse its negative charge to positive. Positively charged GBEPPT rapidly enter into the cell and target the mitochondria. These GBEPPT disturb the homeostasis of mitochondria, inducing mitocytosis-mediated extracellular transport of GBEPPT to the neighboring cells via mitosomes. This intracellular-to-intercellular delivery cycle allows GBEPPT to penetrate deeply into the GBM parenchyma, and exert sustainable action of PPT released from GBEPPT on the tumor cells along its penetration path at the tumor site, thus improving the anti-GBM effect. The process of mitocytosis mediated by the mitochondrion-disturbing nanomedicine may offer great potential in enhancing drug penetration through malignant tissues, especially poorly permeable solid tumors.",

                "value": "Tutorial: “ In this section, we're talking about how to apply all of the different principles of user psych in order to improve growth. Let's talk about this first step in the Reforge Elmer framework. How would we improve emotion? How would we tap into that emotion deeper in order to improve performance of a variable in our model?\n\nAs we talk through all of the different steps to tap into motion, one thing to keep in mind is on our two by two matrix of difficulty and impact improvements that we make to tapping into emotion live up here, they are probably the most difficult things to tap into, but when you do and you hit it, it has the highest impact in terms of performance for the user.\n\nSo one thing that we need to recognize is that every decision in action that we take within product starts with some type of. Either an internal trigger that's a question, a problem, or something else that we have, or an external trigger, something like an email, a product notification, or a call to action within a product.\n\nNow for external triggers, there's eight different channels we can consider. Things like email, mobile, push in product, platform triggers, browser triggers, desktop triggers, paid media, and even something like snail. So when we think about these different triggers in this part, in the emotional journey for our users, that trigger must really try to tap into that core emotion to really sort of drive that action and that decision making.\n\nSo let's talk through the three different steps of how we tap into that emotion. . Well, we're gonna go through three different steps of identifying your strategy and how that impacts things. Then identifying the specific core emotion, and then the four S's of how we improve tapping into that core emotion.\n\nAlong the way, we're gonna be using two different examples, the subscription pet e-commerce product, BarkBox, as well as the self-service expensing tool. Let's start with that first step, identifying the strategy. What we're trying to do here is understand where does our product or feature live on a spectrum of low, medium to high intent.\n\nTypically products that have low intent, meaning that we don't really need them, but we might want 'em, are kind of labeled Candy products, medium intent products, which are things that might be good for us and we have a little bit of intent around, but we don't absolutely need, it doesn't necessarily solve a specific problem or pain are called vitamin product.\n\nAnd on the high intent end of the spectrum, we've got painkiller products. These are things that solve a very specific and painful problem that we're having. So when we think about our two examples, we probably put BarkBox on the candy to vitamin and the of the spectrum. It's something that would be nice to have and we would get entertainment and value out that was along with our pet, but we don't absolutely need it.\n\nIt doesn't solve a super painful. But if we think about something like Expensify, we would put this more on the higher intent painkiller end of the spectrum. Doing expense reports is something that almost every employee has to do at some point, and it's a super painful process in order to get all their receipts together, added up correctly, and submit it.\n\nSo what does this mean in terms of how we tap into emotion? Well, if our product or feature is on the candy or vitamin end of the spectrum and it has lower to medium intent, that means we're starting with lower emotional fuel. Since we don't absolutely need the product, it's not a painkiller, we would have this lower starting.\n\nThat means in order to get somebody take over the decision hill to take the action, we probably need to take a strategy of amping up that emotional fuel, adding positive psych to the steps in the flow. Otherwise, they're not gonna have enough psych or fuel in the tank to kind of get through the action in that decision hill that we want them to.\n\nAnd so this is the exact strategy that we see BarkBox taking place. They're amping up the psychological fuel here. Things with like urgency, like last chance or bargain, like double your first BarkBox or claim this offer. Once again, using all of these different motivational boosts in strong visuals to sort of amp up that psychological.\n\nLet's consider the other end of the spectrum, something that's more on the painkiller end of the spectrum with higher intent. Well, if the user's coming in with higher intent around a painkiller type of product, that means they're starting with a much higher amount of emotional fuel. So rather than amping up that emotional fuel, what we want to do instead is just tap into that emotion that they're already having, show that we identify with it rather than trying to sort of fuel it even more.\n\nThis is exactly what we see with specified with different visuals, such as easy expense reports. Copies such as expense reports that don't suck. They're not really amping up the emotional fuel. Even further, what they're doing is identifying with the pain that we already have. You can imagine if we tried to amp up fuel in a painkiller product even more, we might come across as kind of like a used car salesman.\n\nIt's not gonna come across inauthentic. The other thing that we can take here with that painkiller product, those that are starting off with the higher intent and emotional fuel. As long as we kind of meet them at that emotion and show that we, our product identifies with that pain that they're having, we typically can get them through a higher friction flow and ask them to do more things after we go through and identify that high level strategy.\n\nThe second part is to identify that core emotion that we want to tap. There's four different steps to identify your core emotion. The first is to start with the benefit or the why of your product. This should be informed by the use case map that we built within our retention engagement module. This helps us understand why are they using our product?\n\nWhat is the benefit that they get out of using that product? And once we identify those, We can think about the specific moments that our product solves. So for a candy or vitamin product, we would think about what are the moments and experiences when the person realizes the benefit of your product.\n\nWhat happens in those moments? Get specific. But around a painkiller product, we would take a slightly different approach to this question. We would be asking what are the moments and experiences that your products solve? What happens? What are they doing within those moments? . Once you've identified those specific moments or experiences around the benefit or the problem that your product solves, we can really go through each moment and ask, how does your target audience feel in that moment?\n\nWhat might their emotions be? Would it be frustrated? Would it be excited? Would it be scared? Would it be fear? Right? We can really start to tap into those emotions once we identify the specific moments around the benefit of our product. Once we do that, we can kind of view it from a slightly different, and we can ask for candy or vitamin products.\n\nWhat would they feel if they could experience that positive moment again and again from a painkiller perspective, we can ask the question, how would they feel if they knew they would never have that problem? Again, both of these different angles are going to start to emerge. The different emotions that you can use from the tables that we've put together.\n\nOnce you've identified those, we can then think about, well, how do we improve it? How do we bring that core emotion to life in the various elements of our product? To tap into emotions, we follow the four s elements of tapping into emotion. The first is around selfishness. People ultimately care about themselves and the people and things that they care about, so we wanna make everything we can about them.\n\nYou can see this here in an Airbnb invite email. The credit to this goes to James career from NFX for pointing this out. As you can see here in the subject line and the messaging, they're using a lot of language that is very selfish in nature. Things around you and your, you know, it's about them. You know it's about yourself, and so they're really starting to tap into that selfish.\n\nYou could also see this in the headlines of some of the most popular content pieces. So you can see here you won't be the same. After watching Michael Phelps new Underarmour ad, they've taken a topic about an Underarmour ad and made it about you selfish in nature. You can also see this in the popular New York Times article, why you will Marry the wrong Person.\n\nThey could have just done something about marriage in general, but they've made the title very selfish and they've tapped into some emotional anxiety to make that an even more popular article. The second S element of tapping into motion is around sensory. People need to visualize pictures and language, so we need to use the five sense sight, sound, feeling, smell, and taste them much as we can to really tap into the emotion.\n\nSo here in the BarkBox example, we're using the visual of our Happy dog to really tap into that emotional experience that we get when we see that our pet is very excited and. In the life block example, they're using the visual of this concerned worry looking man to tap into that emotional fuel. A little bit of fear and concern around identity theft protection.\n\nThey don't just describe the experience, they're clearly showing it. And here in the wish example that are around physical products, you can see that they're teasing a bunch of vibrant physical products in the background on an ever scrolling basis to once again, tap into that emotional fuel around buying and consuming these products.\n\nThe third S element of tapping an emotion is to be specific experiences and emotional things are specific, not vague. So when we're describing and using copy rather than describing things in general vague terms, we want to use as specific language as possible. And the fourth s of tapping into motion is trying to be simple.\n\nIf it's too complicated, it requires us to process, which is the logical part of our brain and not the emotional piece. So let's do a quick recap about tapping into emotion. We learn that every flow starts with the trigger, and that trigger needs to tap into emotion. Different strategies for different products, features and flows.\n\nSo for candy and vitamin products, we need to amp up the emotional fuel while painkiller product and features. We kinda need to identify and meet them emotionally as we identify the emotion. We do that by identifying and telling the stories around the specific moments where the problem occurs for our customers or where they experience the benefit that our product gives.\n\nLast but not least, in order to tap into that motion and improve it, we can go through the four S's of tapping into a motion, selfish, specific, sensory, and simple. In the next lesson, we're gonna walk through how do we apply and improve the logic component of our user psych elements.”\n\n------\n\nFollow the tutorial to do the following in great detail and put it in a table:\n\n1) Identify the core emotion:\na. Start by understanding the benefits or the \"why\" of your product.\nb. Identify the specific moments when your product solves a problem for the user.\nc. Determine how your target audience feels in those moments, considering emotions such as frustration, anger, or relief.\nd. Ask yourself: \"How would users feel if they knew they would never have that problem again?\" This will help you identify the core emotion to tap into.\n\n2) Improve tapping into the core emotion using the Four S's:\na. Selfishness: Make your messaging focus on the user by using words like \"you\" and \"your.\" Address their needs and make them feel understood.\nb.

This is key to making sure you are both on the same page so that you are not trying to solve the wrong problem.\n\nTask 2) Label the problems the clients have. Labeling the problem is key to making it less abstract and the solution clearer. The client needs to admit the problem they have as you cannot help solve someone else’s problem until they admit they have one.\n\nTask 3) Overview their history and past experiences ( use hypothetical past experiences ). Seldom will this be the first time someone has tried to solve their problem. Find out what they have already tried and what has and hasn’t worked. Make sure you repeat back their experiences, so they feel heard and to ensure you are actually listening to their problem. Avoid repeating the same failures that the client has already had.\n\nTask 4) Sell them the results that they will get. Show them where they will be, not the journey but the destination. This is why the client came to see you, they are looking for results, but often their vision of those results is blurry. Don’t dive into the details, as the details sound like work. Instead, share the story of what they will get.\n\nTask 5) Explain away their concerns. This step is getting past their no’s and reasons for not purchasing. It can be uncomfortable to hear someone’s objections, but there are typically valid concerns. Going through this step helps you reassure the client that you have a solution for them and makes them feel heard and better-taken care of. It also allows you to pay extra attention to their worries and ensure their concerns are taken care of.\nTheir concerns are:\nlack of Effective communication\nlack of High-quality Design\nlack of Timely delivery / project completion\nlack of Professionalism\nlack of Effective project management\nlack of Competitive pricing / Value for money\nlack of Responsiveness\nlack of Flexibility / Adaptability\nlack of Expertise / Technical knowledge / Industry-specific knowledge\n\nTask 6) Reinforce their decision. When someone buys something, they immediately start questioning if they made the right decision. Did they buy the right product or service? Or did they waste money? You want to reinforce the decision they made so they feel good about themself and their purchase. This happens not only at the initial sale. Every interaction they have with you or the product acts as reinforcement to continue using it, or if it isn’t good, to stop using it."

In this study, the lateral vibrations of a single disc rotor bearing system are studied. The effect of crack location, crack depth, and number of cracks has been studied for structural health monitoring of shafts. For the finite element approach, Ansys version 19.0 is used, and a modal analysis was conducted in order to determine the participation factor and bending modal frequencies. Also, a Campbell diagram for critical speeds and whirl direction is plotted. A single-disc rotor bearing system is treated as a simply supported case. Experimental performance has been carried out on a self-designed testbed, and results are obtained using a DEWEsoft FFT Analyzer. A plot of the frequency spectrum is plotted for all shaft cases. After comparing FEA and Experimental results, a maximum variation of 5 percent was found. The investigational results are corelated; hence, the above methodology for rotordynamic analysis may be suggested.",

These properties also make such materials excellent candidates for use in actuators. The need for rapid, high force linear response effectively limits the materials choice to piezoceramics [10]. An inertial actuator can be thought of as applying forces to a structure that are reacted by accelerating a supported mass. Even though piezoceramic materials are capable of providing high forces, there has been little prior development of inertial actuators using them, largely because of the small strains (displacements) developed and high inherent stiffness. Both of these factors limit the practical performance achievable using direct piezoelectric acceleration of a given mass in the frequency range of interest. The development and use of mechanical ampliﬁcation methods is essential to the practical success of piezoceramic inertial actuation. Several approaches to mechanical ampliﬁcation [11–15] were explored in this research. Fig. 1 shows schematically three of the general concepts considered. For purposes of discussion, these may be considered to be either planar or axisymmetric. In the ‘‘lever’’ concept, the expansion of a piezoelectric element is mechanically ampliﬁed through a hinged linkage to produce larger motions of the attached mass",

The produced Ti60Zr20Si8Ge7B3Sn2 ribbons were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction to confirm their amorphous structure, and their corrosion properties were further investigated by open-circuit potential and cyclic polarization tests. The ribbon’s surface was functionalized by tannic acid, a natural plant-based polyphenol, to enhance its performance in terms of corrosion prevention and antimicrobial efficacy. These properties can potentially be exploited in the premucosal parts of dental implants (abutments). The Folin and Ciocalteu test was used for the quantification of tannic acid (TA) grafted on the ribbon surface and of its redox activity. Fluorescent microscopy and ζ-potential measurements were used to confirm the presence of TA on the surfaces of the ribbons. The cytocompatibility evaluation (indirect and direct) of TA-functionalized Ti60Zr20Si8Ge7B3Sn2 MG ribbons toward primary human gingival fibroblast  demonstrated that no significant differences in cell viability were detected between the functionalized and as-produced (control) MG ribbons. Finally, the antibacterial investigation of TA-functionalized samples against Staphylococcus aureus demonstrated the specimens’ antimicrobial properties, shown by scanning electron microscopy images after 24 h, presenting a few single colonies remaining on their surfaces.

On the other hand, despite their importance, there are few reports on research strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of MMA. This paper reports that catalytic carbon nanosubstrates rather than metalbased substrates, such as Mo, Cu, and stainless steel, are essential in MMA to improve the electrochemical performance of RMBs. In particular, three-dimensional macroporous graphitic carbon nanosubstrates (GC-NSs) with high electrical conductivities can accommodate Mg metal with significantly higher rate capabilities and Coulombic efficiencies than metal substrates, resulting in more stable and longer-term cycling performance over 1,000 cycles. In addition, while metal-based substrates suffered from undesirable Mg peeling-off, homogeneous Mg metal deposition is well guided in GC-NSs, owing to the better affinity of the Mg2+ ion. These results are supported by density functional theory calculations and ex-situ characterization",

Indeed, there is evidence that CAVLM neurons may contribute to energy conservation. For example, optogenetic activation of CA neurons in the rostral VLM reduces heart rate 45 , a key characteristic of low metabolic rates in small animals experiencing food shortage periods. Therefore, it seems that CAVLM neurons might exert subtle actions to maintain energy homeostasis during fasting. CA neurons in the rostral and intermediate portions of the VLM (called C1 neurons) are activated by various stressors and have been proposed as the body’s ‘emergency medical technicians’46 . Considering that most fasting-activated CAVLM neurons reside in the C1 area and that activation of C1 neurons rather than CA neurons in the caudal VLM increases plasma corticosterone levels 32 , C1 neurons are most likely involved in the regulation of T cell homing, although we cannot rule out the role of other CAVLM neurons. As a well-known stress center that responds to various stressors47,48 , CRHPVN neurons have recently been shown to control restraint stress-induced monocyte and lymphocyte migration from blood and SLOs to the BM through glucocorticoid signaling 49 . Immune cell migration can be induced by various stressors, including social stress and exercise50,51 .

Moreover, m6A and glycolysis-related genes (GRGs) play important roles in immunotherapeutic and prognostic implication of GC. However, GRGs involved in m6A regulation have never been analyzed comprehensively in GC. Herein, the study aims to identify and validate a novel signature based on m6A-related GRGs in GC patients. Therefore, a m6A-related GRGs signature is established, which can predict the survival of patients with GC and remain an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analyses. Clinical significance of the model is well validated in internal cohort and independent validation cohort. In addition, the expression levels of risk model-related GRGs in clinical samples are validated. Consistent with the database results, all model genes are up-regulated in expression except DCN. After regrouping the patients based on this risk model, the study can effectively distinguish between them in respect to immune-cell infiltration microenvironment and immunotherapeutic response. Additionally, candidate drugs targeting risk model-related GRGs are confirmed. Finally, a nomogram combining risk scores and clinical parameters is created, and calibration plots show that the nomogram can accurately predict survival.

HIFs regulate different signaling pathways, which are implicated in the cell viability, proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance [11]. However, other pathways including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)-Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and NADPH oxidase (NOX) facilitate the adaption of tumor cells to hypoxia [1, 12, 13]. Besides, HIFs have been shown to facilitate exosomes biogenesis and secretion [14]. Exosomes a subfamily of extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication by carrying different biological molecules among cells. These vesicles contain various biological molecules like proteins, RNAs (coding and non-coding RNAs), DNAs, and lipids, regulating activation of different signaling pathways in recipient cells located nearby or distant tissues [15, 16]. It has been shown that exosomes derived from tumor cells participate in modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting tumorigenesis [17, 18]. Confirmed that, hypoxia induces exosomes biogenesis and secretion and thereby promotes tumor intercellular communication, representing the key role of exosomes in hypoxic tumors [14, 19].

Herein, we report the development of metal hydoxide@polymer composites via matrix-incorporation and spray-coating methods and the assessment of the impact of different preparation methods on their physiochemical properties and detoxification performance. Specifically, Zr(OH)4 and Ce(OH)4 were used to enhance the catalytic activity of Ultem, Matrimid, and PIM-1 polymers toward hydrolysis of dimethyl 4-nitrophenylphosphonate (DMNP) simulant. Two different preparation techniques were employed to assess the structure-performance relations in the developed composites in terms of DMNP detoxification performance. The results obtained indicated that surface-coated metal hydoxide@polymer composites outperformed their respective incorporated analogues for both Zr(OH)4 and Ce(OH)4 due to the presence of more accessible surface active sites. Moreover, it was found that Ce(OH)4 gave rise to a faster detoxification rate than Zr(OH)4 in both matrix-incorporated and surface-coated composites owing to higher Lewis acidity of Ce(OH)4 than Zr(OH)4. Among the materials investigated, the best-performing material was found to be surface-coated Ce(OH)4@PIM-1, which exhibited the fastest DMNP detoxification rate of 0.08 min–1 and the shortest half-life of 8.67 min. The findings of this investigation highlight the potential of the spray-coating method for fabricating composites effective for detoxification of toxic chemicals and vapors.",

In conjunction with pattern recognition, meat freshness at different storage periods was readily discerned, revealing that the as-fabricated colorimetric sensor array possessed excellent discrimination ability. The linear range for quantitative analysis of volatiles related to meat spoilage was from 5 ppm to 100 ppm, with a limit of detection at the ppb level (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the testing results obtained by the sensor in assessing meat freshness were validated by a standard method for measuring the total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N). The sensing signals showed good agreement with the results obtained in TVB-N when measuring real food samples. The sensor also displayed good reproducibility (RSD < 5%) and long-term stability. The sensor was successfully used for on-site and real-time determination of volatiles emitted from rotting meat, demonstrating its potential application in monitoring the quality and safety of meat products.",

Notwithstanding the recent progress, the problematic polysulﬁde shuttling, retarded sulfur redox, and low output of volumetric capacity remain daunting challenges toward its practicability. In response, this work demonstrates herein a universal approach to in situ craft MOx-MXene (M: Ti, V, and Nb) heterostructures as heavy and multifunctional hosts to harvest good battery performances with synchronous polysulﬁde immobilization and conversion. Theoretical calculations indicate that the in situ implanted oxides boost the reaction kinetics of polysulﬁde transformation without aﬀecting the intrinsic conductivity of MXene. As a result, the representative VOx-V2 C/S electrode enables a high volumetric capacity (oﬀering 1645.98 mAh cm−3 at 0.2 C) and cycling stability (retaining 631.17 mAh cm−3 after 1500 cycles at 2.0 C with a capacity decay of 0.03% per cycle). More encouragingly, 3Dprinted sulfur electrodes harnessing VOx-V2 C hosts readily harvest an areal capacity of 9.74 mAh cm−2 at 0.05 C under an elevated sulfur loading of 10.78 mg cm−2 , holding promise for the development of practically viable Li−S batterie",

Here, VN clusters with nitrogen-vacancy embedded in carbon (C) (Nv-VN/C-SS-2) are prepared for the first time to improve the slow reaction kinetics. The nitrogen vacancies can effectively accelerate the reaction kinetics, reduce the electrochemical polarization, and improve the performance. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations also prove that the rapid adsorption and desorption of zinc ions on Nv-VN/C-SS-2 can release more electrons to the delocalized electron cloud of the material, thus adding more active sites. The Nv-VN/C-SS-2 exhibits a specific capacity and outstanding cycle life. Meanwhile, the quasi-solid-state battery exhibits a high capacity of 186.5 mAh g−1, ultra-high energy density of 278.9 Wh kg−1, and a high power density of 2375.1 W kg−1 at 2.5 A g−1, showing excellent electrochemical performance.

However, the actual effect of GO is far below the theoretical prediction. This is mainly due to the weak interface between the nanofiller and the matrix. In this paper, a controllable method for improving interlayer stress transfer of double-layer graphene oxide/C–S–H (D-GO–CSH)-layered nanostructures is proposed by using interlayer sp3 bond and chirality. The results show that, compared with the control group, the normalized shear stress and normalized pull-out energy of the OH-sp3 model are increased by 44.93 and 49.25%, respectively, while those of the OO-sp3 model are increased by 32.26 and 31.03%, respectively. The interlayer sp3 bonds lead to a great enhancement (more than 3 times) in normalized interlayer stress transfer of D-GO–CSH-layered nanostructures while exerting a little opposite effect (about 5%). The improvement effects induced by the interlayer sp3 bonds are also strongly dependent on their distributions and the chirality of GO. According to the fracture mechanic theory and molecular dynamics results, the strain energy percentage difference (bond length and bond angle) of the zigzag-cen model is 34.8% lower than that of the control group model, which proves that the interlayer sp3 bonds have a remarkably positive effect on the interlayer stress transfer of D-GO–CSH-layered nanostructures. This provides a new way to further improve the interlayer stress transfer, pull-out energy, and interlayer shear stress of D-GO–CSH-layered nanostructures.",

The process of urbanization occupied much high-quality farmland, which created an issue with farmland marginalization in this region (Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b). With the rapid advancement of urbanization, many farmers have moved to cities, resulting in idle farmhouses and abandoned farmland (Wu et al., 2022). Furthermore, the intensiﬁcation of human activities, fragile ecologies, and rapid urbanization have aggravated ecological degradation in special areas (Zhang Q et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2021). The main reason for these problems is that the land use in mountainous areas is more restrictive than that in plain areas and the transition process is longer. Furthermore, due to the impacts of landform, the land use form and the process and mode of urbanization and industrialization in mountainous areas are also quite different from those in plain areas.

In this work, we combined the deep learning-based image recognization model with peridynamic method to analyze the dynamic process of crack propagation in transition-layer and dual-layer coatings, and evaluate their crack resistance. Through the establishment of high-precision discrete models based on the real coating morphology and simulation of fracture behavior under tensile loading conditions, it was found that the transition structure leads to more dispersed crack initiation positions, followed by forming a complex network-like crack propagation pathway which involves the connection of isolated cracks with each other. The crack resistance behavior of the coating was evaluated by quantifying the number of broken peridynamic bonds and calculating the fracture energy of the coating. The results showed that, compared with dual-layer coatings, transition-layer coatings exhibit lower fracture energy in the initial stage of failure, followed by an increase and exceeding that of the dual-layer coating. The transition structure facilitates crack initiation while impeding crack growth and delaying the failure process.",

Employing precise welding techniques are essential to minimize degradation of the mechanical properties of welded joints, particularly in preventing the formation of brittle phases and ensuring long-term service reliability. To accomplish this, a thorough examination of the hardness properties of two different S690QL steel welded joints was conducted using Vickers hardness testing. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was used to complement the hardness assessments. Thicker joints show lower hardness values in the heat-affected zone due to slower cooling rates. Conversely, higher hardness values in the upper sections of welds imply the influence of increased heat input during final tempering steps. This research underscores the significance of precise heat treatment techniques in mitigating residual stresses, controlling the characteristics of the heat-affected zone and enhancing mechanical properties, thus contributing to improve structural integrity and safety.",

Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2022 169 094505 spectra for both synthesized compounds that demonstrate the excellent repeatability of the synthesis process. The absorption peaks occurring between 1,252 and 1,395 cm−1 are resulted from the stretching vibrations of νas (O–P–O), while the vibration bands at 1,150 and 1,170 cm−1 are attributed to the deformation vibrations of νs (O–P–O). The broadband at 807 − 1,090 cm−1 is attributed to the νas (P-O-P) stretching vibrations while the absorption peaks at 670 − 785 cm−1 correspond to the deformation vibrations of νs (P–O–P). Whereas, the absorption peaks at 422 − 534 cm−1 are assigned to the bending vibrations of δ (P–O–P) and δ (O–P–O). The appearance of the broadband at 3,458 cm−1 and absorption peak at 1,632 cm−1 can be attributed to the O–H stretching and bending modes of the adsorbed water molecules. Accordingly, three possible crystal structures of CUP were reported in the literature,48,62–64 i.e., the monoclinic crystal structures with the space group C2/c, the orthorhombic crystal structure with the space group Pnma, and the triclinic crystal structures with the space group P1. Nevertheless, the orthorhombic form was found to be the most stable crystal structure, which can be achieved via crystallization under speciﬁc processing conditions. Single-crystal XRD was performed by using a Kappa Apex II Duo X-ray Diffractometer (Bruker AXS LLC, Madison, WI) to evaluate the crystal structure of the synthesized CUP powder (Fig. S3 and Table SI). It was shown that the synthesized CUP crystals are orthorhombic with the Pmna space groups. The powder XRD results provide the information of the CUP crystal structure as well as the purity of the synthesized CUP material (Fig. S4). The spectra of the two samples synthesized from two different batches are the same, indicating the identical crystal structures of the two samples, i.e., orthorhombic. Meanwhile, no additional peaks were detected and, therefore, other types of crystal lattices are not present in the samples. According to the work by Onoda and coauthors, 65 after grinding for a long period of time, the surface P–O–P bonding in ultraphosphates is expected to convert into P–O–H bonding. However, no differences were detected in the XRD spectra of the samples before and after grinding with the mortar and pestle in the present study. As a result, the crystal structure of the CUP powder remained the same from batch to batch and after the grinding process, which indicates the high reproducibility of the CUP synthesis process.",

However, intermittent power generation from renewable energy sources and increased peak load due to EV charging can pose technical challenges for the power systems. Improved load matching through energy system optimization can minimize these challenges. This paper assesses the optimal urban-scale energy matching potentials in a net-zero energy city powered by wind and solar energy, considering three EV charging scenarios: opportunistic charging, smart charging, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G). A city on the west coast of Sweden is used as a case study. The smart charging and V2G schemes aim to minimize the mismatch between generation and load, and are formulated as quadratic programming problems. The simulation results show that the optimal load matching performance is achieved in a net-zero energy city with the V2G scheme and a wind-PV electricity production share of 70:30. The load matching performance in the optimal net-zero energy city is increased from 68% with opportunistic charging to 73% with smart charging and further to 84% with V2G. It is also shown that a 2.4 GWh EV battery participating in the V2G scheme equals 1.4 GWh stationary energy storage in improving urban-scale load matching performance.

This study introduces a simple and cost-effective method for producing these structures, utilizing Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) printed mold and silicone casting. The mold features a top layer with straight lines separated by gaps. A sharp acute angle is formed between a rounded filament and a relatively flat surface. This acute angle can be exploited to have the high edge angle of the desired reentrant structure upon replication with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The best-performing reentrant surface structure obtained has an average edge angle of ∼120° with additional surface topography on top of the structure due to material stacking during printing. It exhibited anisotropic wetting with an optimal water static contact angle of 160° and a minimal rolling angle of 29° for a 10 µL droplet. Furthermore, the structures also demonstrated superior repellency to ethylene glycol, a liquid with surface tension 35% lower than water.

Herein, this work presents a new paradigm for designing a porous PIL-polyacrylic acid (PAA) membrane with a distinct MNP gradient via a top-bottom diffusion approach involving a metal salt precursor solution and NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The strong binding sites provided by PILs, combined with the gradient distribution of -COO− groups across the membrane cross-section, play a significant role in controlling the MNPs’ gradient distribution. Interestingly, the MNPs within the membrane display excellent catalytic activity in exothermic reactions such as H2O2 decomposition, dissipating uneven heat that quickly permeates the membrane network. This induces asymmetrical swelling of polymer chains, resulting in rapid membrane bending. Furthermore, such MNP-loaded membrane could serve as a portable test paper for visually monitoring H2O2. This advancement paves the way for the development of intricate smart actuation materials and expands their practical applications in various real-life scenarios.",

The occlusal surfaces were abraded using water-cooled sandpaper (800 grit). The residual crowns were embedded in self-cured acrylic resin with the flat dentin surface exposed. A mesio-distal trench was created using a calibrated 0.5 mm deep occlusal reduction burr, and artificial dentin caries were generated by pH cycling. Then, teeth were randomly assigned to five groups according to the ion-releasing material used. For each sample, micro-CT acquisitions were performed at various intervals. Remineralization was assessed by mean gray value (MGV) measurements after registration and segmentation of the region of interest with 3D Slicer software. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was used to investigate the difference in MGVs among the various groups.Only Cention Forte showed significantly increased MGVs after 4 weeks compared to demineralized dentin. MGVs were higher, but not significantly, after placement of the restorative materials, including in the resin composite control group. These results can be explained by the radiopacity of the materials.Cention Forte, the material with the highest radiopacity, showed a significant increase in the MGVs of artificially carious dentin after 4 weeks. However, the study of dentin remineralization by micro-CT could be impacted by the radiopacity of the restorative materials used. The relevance of this examination for the study of dentinal remineralization should be investigated.",

The first reported mimic contained a Zn(II) bound to three histidine imidazole nitrogens and an exogenous water molecule, closely mimicking the native enzymes’ first coordination sphere. Co(II) has served as an alternative metal to interrogate CAs due to its d7 electronic configuration for more detailed solution characterization. We present here the Co(II) substituted [Co(II)(H2O/OH−)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3n+ that behaves similarly to native Co(II) substituted human-CAs. Like the Zn(II) analogue, the cobalt-derivative at slightly basic pH is incapable of hydrolyzing p‑nitrophenylacetate (pNPA); however, as the pH is increased a significant activity develops, which at pH values above 10 eventually yields a catalytic efficiency that exceeds that of the [Zn(II)(OH−)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3+. X-ray absorption analysis is consistent with an octahedral species at pH 7.5 that converts to a 5-coordinate species by pH 11. UV-vis spectroscopy monitors this transition, giving a pKa value of 10.3. We assign this conversion to the formation of a 5-coordinate Co(II)(Nimid)3(OH)(H2O) species.

At least four different families of SSA proteins have been identiﬁed, based on their distinct 3-dimensional folds.

Herein, a multistage annular functionalized carbon nanotube array device designed for the seamless integration of complex biological sample separation and multimarker detection is introduced. This device resorts to the supersmooth fluidity of the liquid sample in the carbon nanotubes interstice through rotation assistance, achieving the ability to quickly separate impurities and capture biomarkers (1 mL sample cost time of 2.5 s). Fluid dynamics simulations show that the reduction of near-surface hydrodynamic resistance drives the capture of bacteria and related biomarkers on the functionalized surface of carbon nanotube in sufficient time.

The authors suggested that in the absence of Orf, Red? may be unable to access DNA coated by SSB (63). Orf is not present in the recombination assay that we used, and our data clearly show that a productive interaction between Red? and SSB can occur in the absence of Orf. However, the potential effect of Orf on this recombination system has not yet been tested, and it is conceivable that Orf could bind to SSB and somehow modify it to allow for easier displacement by Red?. In summary, our results suggest a dual role for the CTD, first in binding to ? Exo to facilitate loading of Red? directly onto the 3′-overhang of the first DNA molecule (Figure 1A), and second in binding to SSB to gain access to the ssDNA exposed on the second DNA molecule, likely at the lagging strand of a replication fork (Figure 8). While direct demonstration of these processes will require further biochemical studies, our mutational data suggest that both of these interactions are required for dsDNA recombination, while only the latter activity, binding to SSB, is required for ssDNA recombination. The crystal structure of the Red? CTD and its complex with ? Exo now provide a framework for probing these activities in more detail",

Although CQDs can act as charge mediator for electrons storage and transfer, it is crucial to construct efficient interfaces, which serves as active sites for tight connect with g-C3N4 and fast release of electrons. Herein, a novel iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon quantum dots (Fe, N-CQDs) assembled g-C3N4 composite (FNCCN) was constructed via FeN bridge by hydrothermal and thermal polymerization methods. The FNCNN rivaled popular nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) combined with g-C3N4 composites for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation and degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The SMX degradation rate (0.0963 min−1) is 5.38 and 3.15 times higher than that of g-C3N4 and N-CQDs/g-C3N4. The characterization and DFT calculation results suggest that Fe, N-CQDs was successfully incorporated into carbon matrix of g-C3N4 via FeN covalent bond, which joints the two counterparts closely and creates electron transport channels for higher electrons transfer efficiency. The FeN coordinated structure promotes PMS reduction on Fe2+ of FeN sites for HO and SO4- production and expedited photo carries separation through Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling. In addition, the degradation efficiency, ROS identification, EPR test and degradation pathway of SMX was determined, and the intermediate toxicity of degradation products was predicted.

We develop an end-to-end framework, from code to vectorization, that integrates deep RL in the LLVM compiler. Our proposed framework takes benchmark codes as input and extracts the loop codes. These loop codes are then fed to a loop embedding generator that learns an embedding for these loops. Finally, the learned embeddings are used as input to a Deep RL agent, which dynamically determines the vectorization factors for all the loops. We further extend our framework to support random search, decision trees, supervised neural networks, and nearest-neighbor search. We evaluate our approaches against the currently used LLVM vectorizer and loop polyhedral optimization techniques.

With the growing ubiquity of Wi-Fi networks, the need to secure these networks from unauthorized access and malicious activities has become increasingly important. This section presents an overview of the fundamental concepts and protocols that underlie Wi-Fi network security, such as WEP, WPA/WPA2, and WPA3.\n\nWired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was the first security protocol introduced for wireless networks. It was part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard released in 1997 [1]. WEP aimed to provide a level of security comparable to that of wired networks by employing the RC4 encryption algorithm and using a shared secret key for authentication. However, due to various weaknesses and vulnerabilities, WEP is now considered insecure [2]. For example, WEP's reliance on static keys and a weak initialization vector (IV) led to its susceptibility to attacks like the Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir (FMS) attack [3].\n\nTo address the security concerns associated with WEP, the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol was introduced in 2003 [4]. WPA improved upon WEP by introducing the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for encryption and the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for authentication. Although WPA provided significant security enhancements over WEP, it was still vulnerable to certain attacks, such as dictionary and brute-force attacks [5].\n\nWPA2, introduced in 2004, replaced WPA as the dominant Wi-Fi security standard [6]. WPA2 introduced the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-based Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) as a mandatory encryption protocol, offering better security than TKIP [7]. WPA2 also provides two modes: Personal (WPA2-PSK) and Enterprise (WPA2-EAP), catering to different security requirements and environments [8].\n\nIn 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced WPA3 to further improve Wi-Fi network security [9]. WPA3 enhances security by implementing the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) protocol for key establishment, which mitigates offline dictionary attacks [10]. Additionally, WPA3 employs 192-bit security for enterprise networks and introduces the Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) for open networks, providing encrypted communication without authentication [11].\n\nIn conclusion, the evolution of Wi-Fi network security has led to the development of advanced protocols like WPA2 and WPA3, which provide significantly better protection against unauthorized access and malicious activities than their predecessors. Ensuring the secure operation of Wi-Fi networks is a critical aspect of modern wireless communication systems.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] IEEE, \"IEEE Std 802.11-1997,\" IEEE Standard for Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications, 1997.\n\n[2] B.

The results of the single-factor experiment showed that a long reaction time and high acidmaterial ratio were conducive to improving the extraction rate of F. Under the conditions of 275 ◦C and 5 doses of sulfuric acid, the optimum F extraction rate was realized by roasting for 4 h with 1 dose of Al2O3 as the catalyst.

Following observations of the CNS-modulating eﬀects of chlorpromazine as an anesthetic, it was supplied to a small group of psychiatrists who trialed the drug in schizophrenic and manic patients (Shen, 1999). Symptomatic relief and functional improvement in patients, paired with a global decrease of psychiatric inpatient admissions, rapidly conﬁrmed chlorpromazine as a drug of profound clinical signiﬁcance. Following the success of chlorpromazine, molecular modiﬁcation of compounds with similar chemical structures gained momentum. Imipramine, developed as a weak anti-histamine with mild anti-cholinergic eﬀects, proved ineﬀective in schizophrenia, however early researchers recognized the potential mood modifying eﬀects of the drug and it was released for clinical use within a year of its ﬁrst publication (Pereira and Hiroaki-Sato, 2018). Parallel to these studies, the clinical eﬀects of iproniazid were also being investigated, with the observation this drug greatly stimulated the CNS initially being listed as a side eﬀect, before the potential of this stimulation was realized",

In contrast, baghdadite (BAG, Ca3ZrSi2O9), a calcium zirconium silicate-based bioceramic, exhibits outstanding biological properties, to promote cell proliferation and differentiation of human osteoblasts along with adequate mechanical strength. In this study, plasma-sprayed HA, BAG, and carbon nanotubes (CNT, 1 wt%, and 2 wt%) reinforced BAG coatings are deposited on titanium (Ti) substrate to enhance its mechanical as well as biological properties. The microhardness values of CNT-reinforced BAG coatings increase due to a decrease in porosity and the retention of CNT inside the BAG matrix. Progressive loading scratch tests are performed, revealing a reduction in wear volume loss from 15.051 mm3 to 12.574 mm3 and scratch rate from 43.262 mm3N−1 m−1 to 36.172 mm3N−1 m−1 with the addition of 2 wt% CNT in BAG coatings. The scratch hardness test results demonstrated that introducing CNT into BAG coating significantly enhances its performance, showing a remarkable 38.7 % improvement.

However, suboptimal interface contacts between electron transport layer (ETL) (such as C60) and the perovskite absorbing layer within inverted PSCs always result in reduced efficiency and poor stability. Herein, a surface state manipulation strategy has been developed by employing a highly electronegative 4-fluorophenethylamine hydrochloride (p-F-PEACl) to effectively address the issue of poor interface contacts in the inverted PSCs. The p-F-PEACl demonstrates a robust interaction with perovskite film through bonding of amino group and Cl− with I− and Pb2+ ions in the perovskite, respectively. As such, the surface defects of perovskite film can be significantly reduced, leading to suppressed non-radiative recombination. Moreover, p-F-PEACl also plays a dual role in enhancing the surface potential and improving energy-level alignment at the interfaces between the perovskite and C60 carrier transport layer, which directly contributes to efficient charge extraction. Finally, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of devices increases from 1.104 V to 1.157 V, leading to an overall efficiency improvement from 22.34% to 24.78%. Furthermore, the p-F-PEACl-treated PSCs also display excellent stability.",

It provides high temporal resolution with excellent spatial accuracy and can be used to track changes in neural activity related to cognitive processes such as attention or memory formation over time. MEG has been used for auditory BCI research but also shows potential for visual BCIs as well as multimodal approaches combining MEG with other modalities such as EEG or fMRI. One of the important factors affecting signal resolution is sensor density: more sensors mean more accurate localization of neural activity within the brain, allowing better control over output devices such as robotic limbs or computer cursors. Increasing sensor density above 30–50 sensors per cm3 can signiﬁcantly improve spatial resolution and accuracy when compared to lower densities. However, this must be balanced against increased costs associated with higher numbers of sensors as well as any potential interference between closely spaced elements due to mutual inductance. In addition to sensor density, placement also plays an important role in determining signal ﬁdelity. Ideally, each individual’s head should be modeled before placing electrodes so that they are optimally positioned based on their unique anatomy. Furthermore, optimal placement may vary depending on what type of information one wants to extract from recorded data. For example, if one wishes to study motor cortex activation, it would make sense to place electrodes near primary motor areas, while studying visual cortex activation might require different locations. Using multiple layers of overlapping grids can help reduce noise levels caused by external sources such as power lines or electronic equipment, although further research into this area is still needed before deﬁnitive conclusions can be drawn about its efﬁcacy",

Her motivation is to prove herself to others and regain her self-worth. As she becomes more involved in the group's investigations, she discovers her own resilience and the value of trust and friendship. Jasmine seeks to uncover the mysteries of the Devil's Den to confront her own fears and find a sense of control in her life.\n3. Pretzel: Pretzel is an introverted, tech-savvy teen who finds solace in his intelligence and skills. His motivation is to connect with others and find a place where he feels truly accepted.

He is driven to help solve the supernatural mysteries to prove his worth and to protect the friends he's made at Los Padrinos.\n4. Heather: As a gifted artist, Heather has a unique perspective on the world around her, which allows her to see beyond the ordinary. Her motivation is to overcome her insecurities and embrace her creative talents.

Yes, I would like to see her struggle with reconciling her duality as she tries to understand the events that unfold, and create a valid model for how this new world that she finds herself works; with a keen sense for the laws that determine how people interrelate, and a growing acceptance of the mystical unknown.\n\n2. I do envision Heather's powers developing and growing and becoming more useful over the course of the series, sometimes her powers might seem they might even endanger her, in the sense that they exhaust and frighten her, as though her powers have drawn from the facility itself. She may, for instance, hear voices or see unseen figures, similar to Danny in The Shining.\n\n3. Carlos experiences a profound transformation, and this aligns thematically with the changes in the facility in which our story is set. Also, ideas of masculinity and power will come to the forefront, and complexity in how much vulnerability a person can show in such threatening conditions, as well as how a character experiencing such duality can relate to others in his community.\n\n4. Pretzel should experience transformation that comes from a new awareness of limitations, when available tools and structures cannot be used to explain or to solve. Jasmine is someone who has grown up fending for herself, and believed that she can count on no one to fight for her or support her or protect her. However, she will learn to trust and even to feel love for those she allows to get close.\n\n5. Some themes to explore: punishment and forgiveness, modernity, struggle with authority, class awareness, authenticity (as in how the new management of the facility presents itself versus how the people detained therein experience an overwhelming darkness and encroaching depravity). I will take your guidance on possible storylines that can thread any of these themes and will make for a very compelling and marketable TV show for audiences of the intended age.\n\nAs for balancing the stories of the larger narrative arc and the episodic storylines, I'd take cues from other successful series in the mystery genre such as \"X-Files\" and \"Supernatural\"."

To illustrate Alex's struggle with reconciling her duality, we can have episodes where she faces challenges that force her to confront her skepticism and draw upon her cultural background. For example, there could be a situation where a supernatural occurrence defies conventional explanations, and Alex must rely on her mother's spiritual teachings to make sense of it. This conflict will be a recurring theme, allowing her character to grow and evolve over time.\n2. As Heather's powers develop, we can introduce new abilities and challenges for her character. For example, she might start to see visions of the past or future, which could be both helpful and overwhelming. Her growing connection to the facility might also lead her to uncover hidden secrets that others would prefer to remain buried. This could put her in danger, and she'll need to rely on her newfound friends for support and protection.\n3. Carlos's journey will be about self-discovery and finding acceptance, both within himself and from others. We can explore themes of masculinity, power, and vulnerability through Carlos's interactions with his fellow inmates, the staff at Los Padrinos, and his own internal struggles. His character arc can serve as a metaphor for the transformative nature of the facility itself.\n4. Pretzel's character development can focus on him learning to adapt when his usual tools and methods fail him. In these moments, he'll discover new strengths and resourcefulness within himself. Jasmine's journey will be about opening up to others, learning to trust, and finding strength in her relationships with the group. Her growing bond with the other characters can be a source of emotional depth for the series.\n5. For episodic storylines, we can explore themes such as punishment and forgiveness, modernity, struggle with authority, class awareness, and authenticity. Here are a few potential storylines that incorporate these themes:\n* A vengeful ghost seeks retribution for a past injustice, forcing the group to confront themes of punishment and forgiveness.\n* The facility's new management implements advanced surveillance technology, creating an atmosphere of control and distrust that the teens must navigate.\n* A series of mysterious events at Los Padrinos reveals a hidden connection to a powerful figure in the community, highlighting themes of class and authority.\n* The group uncovers evidence of a decades-old cover-up involving the facility's dark past, questioning the authenticity of the new management's progressive image.\n\nTo balance the larger narrative arc with episodic storylines, we can use a structure similar to shows like \"X-Files\" and \"Supernatural.\" Each episode will feature a self-contained mystery, while also dropping hints and clues that connect to the overarching story of the Devil's Den and Alex's sister's disappearance. This format will allow us to explore various themes and develop the characters while keeping the audience engaged with a mix of standalone and serialized storytelling.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any additional thoughts or ideas based on these suggestions, and we can continue refining the story together."

Each inmate would be given a designated time slot to access a secure recording booth, where they can privately record their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This would give the characters an opportunity to express themselves candidly, and it would also allow the audience to gain insights into their emotions and motivations.\n\nAnother option could be a \"creative expression\" program, where the teens are encouraged to create art, write poetry, or engage in other forms of artistic expression as a way to process their emotions and experiences. This would provide a visual and narrative platform for the characters to share their thoughts and feelings, and it could be used as a storytelling device throughout the series.\n\nAlternatively, we could have a group therapy session format, where characters take turns sharing their thoughts and feelings in a more structured setting. While this may not be as intimate as a confessional, it would still provide opportunities for the characters to reveal their inner workings and form deeper connections with one another.\n\nPlease let me know which option you prefer or if you have any other ideas for incorporating this stylistic motif into the series.

This character could be fresh out of graduate school, eager to make a difference but also somewhat naive about the realities of working in a juvenile facility. Their authenticity and trustworthiness could be left ambiguous initially, allowing for tension and intrigue as the story unfolds.\n\nIn the pilot episode, we can establish the therapy journal as a recurring stylistic motif by introducing the recording booth early on and having the main characters use it to document their thoughts and feelings.

JAYLEN (21, Black), a carefree sweet-talker, perks up behind the valet podium and blows into his hands for warmth. While the car makes its way to him, Jaylen directs his attention to the nearby group of coworkers and locks eyes with ROX (30, Black), a woman in charge. She nods her managerial approval for him to tuck in the sweet ride. Excited, he bows his head to exaggerate obedience. She cracks a smile.\n\nWhen Maserati finally lands, Jaylen proceeds to eagerly open the driver's door. However, his excitement fizzles when the high and mighty MASERATI OWNER makes eye contact, sighing, with a look that says, \"You again.\" As the Maserati Owner hands over the keys, he makes it clear that Jaylen is to leave the windows down while he parks his vehicle so that it stays smelling fresh. Jaylen swallows the insult and nods, \"Yes, sir, \" while he takes over the wheel. Before he drives, Jaylen watches the Owner disappear into the hotel in a hurry. Then, instead of driving into the parking structure, Jaylen discreetly veers into Broad Street, flipping the Ritz in his rearview mirror. Ahead of him -- shots of City Hall Tower and the William Penn statue, The US Mint, and the giant Christmas tree by the LOVE sculpture at JFK Plaza. Jaylen rides \"flossy\" in the city of brotherly love on a winter day."

Kagara et al. revealed an association between ZIP10, cell inﬁltration, and the metastasis of human breast cancer cells, and they used the real-time quantitative PCR technique to conﬁrm that the breast cancer tissues in patients with lymph node metastasis showed a signiﬁcantly higher ZIP10 mRNA expression level than the breast cancer tissues in those without metastasis. In contrast, cell migration and zinc uptake were attenuated by ZIP10 knockdown in metastatic cell lines [ 22 ]. Additionally, ZIP10 and ZIP6 can combine to form functional heteromeric complexes that interact with neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) to regulate the EMT process [34 ]. Nakase et al. noted that the lack of ZIP6 or ZIP10 and intracellular Zn2+ levels remarkably attenuated the ability of MCF-7 cells to migrate in a 25 mM glucose medium. This ﬁnding suggested that Zn transport via ZIP6 and ZIP10 plays a key role in enhancing the motility of MCF-7 cells at high glucose levels. This raises the possibility that ZIP10 could be used as a prospective marker for the metastatic spread of hyperglycemia in breast cancer [ 35].

Recurrence is nearly universal even after surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves photosensitizer administration followed by light activation to generate reactive oxygen species at tumor sites, thereby killing cells or inducing biological changes. PDT can ablate unresectable GBM and sensitize tumors to chemotherapy. Verteporfin (VP) is a promising photosensitizer that relies on liposomal carriers for clinical use. While lipids increase VP's solubility, they also reduce intracellular photosensitizer accumulation. Here, a pure-drug nanoformulation of VP, termed “NanoVP”, eliminating the need for lipids, excipients, or stabilizers is reported. NanoVP has a tunable size (65–150 nm) and 1500-fold higher photosensitizer loading capacity than liposomal VP. NanoVP shows a 2-fold increase in photosensitizer uptake and superior PDT efficacy in GBM cells compared to liposomal VP. In mouse models, NanoVP-PDT improved tumor control and extended animal survival, outperforming liposomal VP and 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). Moreover, low-dose NanoVP-PDT can safely open the blood-brain barrier, increasing drug accumulation in rat brains by 5.5-fold compared to 5-ALA.

Nevertheless, there is an extreme shortage of highly sensitive and renal clearable iron oxide nanoprobes suitable for early kidney damage detection through MRI. Herein, a renal clearable ultra-small ferrite nanoprobe (UMFNPs@ZDS) is proposed for highly sensitive early diagnosis of kidney damage via structural and functional MRI in vivo for the first time. The nanoprobe comprises a ferrite core coated with a zwitterionic layer, and possesses a high T1 relaxivity (12.52 mm−1s−1), a small hydrodynamic size (6.43 nm), remarkable water solubility, excellent biocompatibility, and impressive renal clearable ability. In a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), the nanoprobe-based MRI can not only accurately visualize the locations of renal injury, but also provide comprehensive functional data including peak value, peak time, relative renal function (RRF), and clearance percentage via MRI.

We achieved this by utilizing commercial resin blends and “customized” resin both loaded with CaCO3 particles. The dual functionality of the “customized” resin, which serves as both a preceramic polymer and photocurable resin, is exploited. To assess the properties of these ceramics, we carried out an in-depth comparative analysis using a combination of spectroscopic, microscopic and analytical techniques. After annealing at 1200 °C, the as-prepared ceramics achieved a relative density of 65% leading to high compressive strength (≈40 MPa). Importantly, β-Ca2SiO4 ceramic scaffolds demonstrated good in vitro bioactivity by promoting hydroxyapatite formation. When subjected to E. coli, scaffolds functionalized with AgNPs/GO showed higher antibacterial activity than their non-functionalized counterparts. Moreover, ceramic scaffolds derived from the “customized” resin exhibited sixfold higher antimicrobial activity than scaffolds made from commercial resin mixtures. To assess biocompatibility, we conducted in vitro studies using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) culture. Encouragingly, all bioceramics proved non-cytotoxic and accelerated the proliferative rate of MSCs compared with the control. After 7 days in culture, cells showed a well-spread morphology with no obvious differences, clearly indicating that bioceramic scaffolds actively promote cell adhesion and viability. Overall, due to their interconnected porosity, excellent biomineralization, mechanical, antibacterial and cytocompatibility properties, these 3D-printed scaffolds hold significant promise as candidates for applications in hard tissue engineering.",

A concomitant liver pathology (eg, NAFLD with hepatitis B) included under the MAFLD Deﬁnition would inevitably increase the level of ﬁbrosis and inﬂammation present in the liver, and the degree of ﬁbrosis is a known risk factor for mortality. 56 Although comparison of outcomes were not possible in the present meta-analysis due to the lack of sufﬁcient data, the analysis of adverse events of MAFLD vs NAFLD presents an important gap in literature that warrants further investigations. Additionally, we found that the current Deﬁnition of MAFLD only accounts for 81.59% of patients with NAFLD. Wong et al found that up to 25.0% of patients with incidental fatty liver were not characterized as MAFLD, presumably from the lower metabolic burden despite an increase in fatty liver, and these discrepancies highlight the potential misclassiﬁcation with the MALFD deﬁnition. 17 Although the presence of obesity is highly associated with fatty liver, 57 there remains a subgroup of lean patients with NAFLD who can potentially be misclassiﬁed with MAFLD. Lean NAFLD accounts for 19.20% of NAFLD diagnoses,10 and these patients are less likely to present with metabolic dysregulation.

Disulfiram (DSF), an FDA-approved medication primarily used for treating alcohol addiction, has exhibited promising anti-tumor properties. Studies have revealed DSF's capacity for enhanced anti-tumor activity, particularly when combined with copper. The novel Copper-Cysteamine (CuCy) compound, Cu3Cl(SR)2 (RCH2CH2NH2), showcases photodynamic effects and demonstrates significant anti-tumor potential under various conditions, including exposure to ultraviolet light, X-ray, microwave, and ultrasound. This study delves into exploring the synergistic anti-tumor effects and underlying mechanisms by utilizing copper-cysteamine in conjunction with DSF against endometrial cancer. The investigation involved comprehensive analyses encompassing in vitro experiments utilizing Ishikawa cells, in vivo studies, and transcriptomic analyses. Remarkably, the combined administration of both compounds at a low dose of 0.5 μM exhibited pronounced efficacy in impeding tumor growth, inhibiting blood vessel formation, and stimulating cell apoptosis. Notably, experiments involving transplanted tumors in nude mice vividly demonstrated the significant in vivo anti-tumor effects of this combination treatment. Detailed examination through transmission electron microscopy unveiled compelling evidence of mitochondrial damage, cellular swelling, and rupture, indicative of apoptotic changes in morphology due to the combined treatment. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis unveiled substantial downregulation of mitochondrial-related genes at the molecular level, coupled with a significant hindrance in the DNA repair pathway. These findings strongly suggest that the combined application of CuCy and DSF induces mitochondrial impairment in Ishikawa cells, thereby fostering apoptosis and ultimately yielding potent anti-tumor effects.",

Yet, its environmental stability, a crucial factor for practical applications, remains largely unexplored. Herein, a comprehensive examination of the stability and electronic properties of the (001) surface of NbAs2 utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and surface science experiments is conducted. The theoretical deductions reveal that As atoms, organized in a buckled honeycomb configuration, terminate the bare (001) surface, akin to the tensile blue arsenene monolayer along the armchair direction. This study further demonstrates that the oxidation barrier is particularly low (only 0.2 eV), highlighting that the (001) surface is highly prone to oxidation under standard conditions, forming a As2O5+Nb2O5/NbAs2 heterostructure. Additionally, it observes that oxidation adversely affects the electronic characteristics of the topological semimetal NbAs2. The conclusions underscore the need for NbAs2 to be managed under high vacuum conditions or to be encapsulated for any usage in the ambient atmosphere in order to retain its electronic properties for practical purposes.",

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is able to hide within host cells to evade immune clearance and antibiotics, leading to life-threatening infections. On-site detection and efficient treatment of intracellular S. aureus infection in wounds remain challenging. Herein, we report a thermosensitive, injectable, visible GELNs-based wound dressing, Van@GELNs/F127 hydrogel (gel Van@GELNs), which is H2O2-responsive and can slowly release vancomycin into host cells forS. aureus infection visualization and treatment in wounds. GELNs show inherent antibacterial activity, which is significantly enhanced after loading vancomycin. Both GELNs and Van@GELNs have the ability to be internalized by cells, so Van@GELNs are more effective than free vancomycin in killing S. aureus in RAW 264.7 macrophages. When applied to an S. aureus-infected wound on a mouse, the colorless HRP&amp;ABTS/Van@GELNs/F127 solution immediately changes to a green hydrogel and shows better therapeutic effect than vancomycin.

However, their translation is still challenged by the insufficient mechanical robustness in the context of complex wounds in dynamic tissues. Herein, we report a tissue-adhesive supramolecular hydrogel membrane based on biocompatible precursors for dressing wounds in highly dynamic tissues, featuring robust mechanical resilience through programmable strain-adaptive entanglement among microdomains. Specifically, the hydrogels are synthesized by incorporating a long-chain polyurethane segment into a Schiff base-ligated short-chain oxidized cellulose/quaternized chitosan network via acylhydrazone bonding, which readily establishes interpenetrating entangled microdomains in dynamic cross-linked hydrogel matrices to enhance their tear and fatigue resistance against extreme mechanical stresses. After being placed onto dynamic tissues, the hydrogel dressing could efficiently absorb blood to achieve rapid hemostasis. Moreover, metal ions released from ruptured erythrocytes could be scavenged by the Schiff base linkers to form additional ionic bonds, which would trigger the cross-linking of the short-chain components and establish abundant crystalline microdomains, eventually leading to the in situ stiffening of the hydrogels to endure heavy mechanical loads. Benefiting from its hemostatic capacity and strain adaptable mechanical performance, this hydrogel wound dressing shows promise for the clinical management of various traumatic wounds.",

However, its development seriously suffers from the entanglement between the photoelectronic and photothermal effects induced by the decay of plasmons, especially under the influence of applied potential. Herein, using LSPR-mediated CO2 reduction on Ag electrocatalyst as a model system, we quantitatively uncover the dominant photoelectronic effect on CO2 reduction reaction over a wide potential window, in contrast to the leading photothermal effect on H2 evolution reaction at relatively negative potentials. The excitation of LSPR selectively enhances the CO faradaic efficiency (17-fold at −0.6 VRHE) and partial current density (100-fold at −0.6 VRHE), suppressing the undesired H2 faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) reveals a plasmon-promoted formation of the bridge-bonded CO on Ag surface via a carbonyl-containing C1 intermediate. The present work demonstrates a deep mechanistic understanding of selective regulation of interfacial reactions by coupling plasmons and electrochemistry.",

Even with existing site-controlled growth techniques, for example, nanohole or buried stressor concepts, a further lithography and etching step with high spatial alignment requirements is necessary to accurately integrate quantum dots into the nanophotonic devices. Here, the fabrication and characterization of strain-induced site-controlled microcavities are reported, where site-controlled quantum dots are positioned at the antinode of the optical mode field in a self-aligned manner without the need of any further nano-processing. It is shown that the cavity properties such as Q-factor, mode volume, and mode splitting can be tailored by the geometry of the integrated buried stressor, with an opening &lt;4 µm. The experimental results are complemented with theory calculations based on continuum elasticity. Lasing signatures, including super-linear input-output response and linewidth narrowing, are observed for a 3.6-µm self-aligned cavity with a Q-factor of 18 000. Furthermore, the quasi-planar site-controlled cavities exhibit no detrimental thermal effects.

The laser beam has 800 nm wavelength, 130 fs pulse duration, a Gaussian spatial profile with a beam waist radius of 13.1μm, and pulse energies of 12 nJ to 186 nJ to generate the applied range of laser fluences. The silicon microring resonators used in the study have a 15μm diameter and are coupled to a waveguide of 500 nm in width with a gap of 260 nm. We found that the multi-shot tuning curves (resonance wavelength shifts as a function of laser fluences) do not monotonically increase with laser fluences: they first increase, then plateau, and finally decrease. We observed that the laser energies required for the multi-shot case to obtain the onset of crystalline modifications and ablation are several times below the single-shot case because of the incubation effect.

Total RNA was extracted from the samples using Trizol. The quantity and purity of the extracted total RNA were assessed using the NanoDrop ND-1000 system. Furthermore, the integrity of the RNA was verified using the Bioanalyzer 2100 system and agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples with a concentration greater than 50 ng/μL, RNA Integrity Number (RIN) value above 7.0, OD260/280 ratio higher than 1.8, and more than 1 μg of total RNA were suitable for subsequent experiments. mRNA molecules containing poly(A) tails were specifically captured using oligo(dT)-coated magnetic beads. Subsequently, the captured mRNA was fragmented under hightemperature conditions. The fragmented RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA using E. coli DNA polymerase I and RNase H, generating double-stranded DNA for subsequent experiments. A base was added to both ends of the DNA fragments to enable ligation with adapters carrying a T base overhang. The size-selected and purified libraries were obtained using magnetic beads. The double-stranded DNA was digested by UDG enzyme (NEB, MA, US), and the resulting fragments were subjected to PCR preamplification. The pre-amplification cycle was performed for 8 cycles: denaturation at 97 ◦C for 15 s, annealing at 65 ◦C for 15 s, extension at 70 ◦C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 70 ◦C for 6 min.

Analyses of lossand gain-of-function of cut mutants in Drosophila have revealed the roles of cut (the Drosophila ortholog of CUX1) in the peripheral nervous system. There are two types of anatomically distinguishable sensory organs, external sensory (es) organs, and internal (chordotonal) sensory organs. In Drosophila, cut is exclusively expressed in cells of the es organ but repressed in cells of the chordotonal organ (37, 38). Therefore, the lethal cut mutants exhibit the transformation of es organs into chordotonal organs (37, 39, 40), whereas forced cut overexpression in Drosophila embryos resulted in the conversion of chordotonal organs into es organs (41). Moreover, the level of Cut is a determinant of the distinct dendrite branching patterns of dendritic arborization (da) sensory in Drosophila (42). Cux1 and Cux2, a homolog protein of Cux1, have been shown to stimulate dendrite branching, spine development, and synapse formation in layers II–III neurons of the cerebral cortex (43, 44). However, an in vitro study showed opposite results indicating that Cux1 suppresses dendritogenesis of neuronal cells (45). Therefore, additional studies are required for clarifying the role of Cux1 in the development of nervous system. Roles of CUX1 in Cell Proliferation, Differentiation, and Migration A number of studies have indicated that the expression and/or the DNA-binding dynamics of CUX1 are in a cell cycle–dependent manner (Figure 2). For example, the expression of histone nuclear factor D (HiNF-D), which includes CUX1 as its DNA-binding partner, was upregulated in S-phase in normal cells (46–50); the CUX1-DNA binding was undetectable in G0 and early G1 phase, became detectable in the late G1 phase, and peaked in S phase (11). This dynamic change of CUX1DNA binding is attributed to at least two posttranslational modiﬁcations, Cdc25A-mediated dephosphorylation at the CUX1 HD domain, and cathepsin L–mediated proteolytic cleavage to generate p110 CUX1 (11, 24, 33); in G2 phase, the binding of CUX1-DNA was attenuated due to CyclinACdk1 mediated phosphorylation of CUX1 (51). In addition, Alain Nepveu group also demonstrated that the cyclin B/CDK1– mediated hyperphosphorylation of CUX1 could reset CUX1 DNA-binding activity to the zero level at each cell division (52). On the other hand, a subset of the downstream target genes of CUX1 has been reported to play a role in cell cycle progression (6, 7, 34, 53). These studies together suggest the involvement of CUX1 in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation. In line with these ﬁndings, cells with p110 CUX1 overexpression showed accelerated entry into S phase and cell proliferation, whereas mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts derived from Cux1z/z mutant mice showed an extended G1 phase and retarded cell proliferation (54). Moreover, Cux1 transgenic mice displayed organomegaly and multiorgan hyperplasia (14). All these in vitro and in vivo ﬁndings indicate the implication of CUX1 in cell proliferation. Early studies have demonstrated that Cux1 is exclusively expressed in undiﬀerentiated cells (21, 55–58), suggesting the role of CUX1 in cell diﬀerentiation. In both mice and humans, Cux1 expression is high in long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) but low in short-term hematopoietic stem cell (ST-HSC) and myeloid progenitors, and in vivo",

Borophene, with the merits of high capacity, high electronic conductivity and fast diffusion kinetics, holds great potential as anode for LIBs. However, it is difficult to fabricate for the intrinsic electron-deficiency of boron atom. Herein, heterogeneous-structured MoB2 (h-MoB2) with amorphous shell and crystalline core, is prepared by solid phase molten salt method. As demonstrated, crystalline core can encapsulate the honeycomb borophene within two adjacent Mo atoms, and amorphous shell can accommodate more lithium ions to strengthen the lithium storage capacity and diffusion kinetics. According to theoretical calculations, the lithium adsorption energy in MoB2 is about −2.7 eV, and the lithium diffusion energy barrier in MoB2 is calculated to be 0.199 eV, guaranteeing the enhanced adsorption capability and fast diffusion kinetic behavior of Li+ ions. As a result, h-MoB2 anode presents high capacity of 798 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, excellent rate performance of 183 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 and long-term cyclic stability for 1200 cycles.

In this study, an epitaxial growth strategy is proposed by synthesizing sulfide rhenium (ReS2) on exfoliated black phosphorus (E-BP) nanosheets, creating an abundance of robust interfacial linkages. Through spectroscopic analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the authors investigate the interfacial environment. The well-developed coupled interface and structural stability contribute to the impressive performance of the 3D-printed E-BP@ReS2-based micro-supercapacitor, achieving a specific capacitance of 47.3 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2 and demonstrating excellent long-term cyclability (89.2% over 2000 cycles). Furthermore, density functional theory calculations unveil the positive impact of the strongly coupled interface in the E-BP@ReS2 nanocomposite on the adsorption of H+ ions, showcasing a significantly reduced adsorption energy of −2.17 eV. The strong coupling effect facilitates directional charge delocalization at the interface, enhancing the electrochemical performance of electrodes and resulting in the successful construction of advanced micro-supercapacitors.",

To address this black box problem, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged, which provides an explanation and interpretation of its decisions, thereby promoting the trustworthiness of AI systems. Here, we present a memristive XAI (MemXAI) hardware framework. This framework incorporates three distinct types of memristors (Mott memristor, valence change memristor, and charge trap memristor), each responsible for performing three essential functions (perturbation, analog multiplication, and integration) required for the XAI hardware implementation. We fabricate three memristor arrays with high robustness and experimentally demonstrate the image recognition of 3 × 3 testing patterns and their explanation map generation. Then, we build a software-based extended system based on the characteristics of this hardware, simulating a large-scale image recognition task. The proposed system can perform the XAI operations with only 4.32% of the energy compared to conventional digital systems, enlightening its strong potential for the XAI accelerator.This article is protected by copyright.

In this work, a feasible surface modification method for microcrystalline cellulose powder (MCC) in all solid states is proposed by using rubber accelerators N-cyclohexyl benzothiazole-2-sulphenamidee (CBS) and 2,2′-dibenzothiazoledisulfide (DM). These accelerators not only accelerate the sulfur crosslink of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), but also graft to rubber molecular chains and form hydrogen bonds with MCC, resulting in good interfacial interaction and good dispersion of MCC in the NBR matrix. As a consequence, the tensile strength and elongation at break of NBR/10MCC reach up to 20.12 MPa and 511%, respectively, which are the highest values of NBR/MCC or cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) composites we can find in the world and are comparable to those of carbon black or mineral fillers.

The obtained materials, because of the presence of humic functional groups, may potentially be used for removing contaminants from aqueous solutions. The quantitative assessment was based on experiments designed according to the Box-Behnken plan. The statistical analysis of the results allowed to determine the optimal conditions of the process tested, for which the isolation efficiency of humic substances (HS) was greater than 50 % for both raw materials. This made it possible to synthesize humic silica composites with a high content of HS, which have been qualitatively evaluated. This step was focused on the analysis of the humic structure using elemental analysis, spectroscopic methods, and differential thermal analysis coupled with thermogravimetry. On the basis of them, the presence of structures characteristic for HS in the HSiC tested was observed. Moreover, the results of the thermal analysis pointed to the higher thermal stability of the synthesized compounds, compared to the HS isolated with the use of a traditional extractant.",

However, the underlying origin and regulation strategy have never been reported. In this work, we proposed an advanced in-situ anionic group anchoring strategy utilizing the strain effect between external NCZ-LDH and internal NiMoO4. Combining experiments with theoretical calculation, we confirmed that the self-discharge behavior of battery-type cathodes is highly related with the dissociation reaction of H2O in fully charged state, while the defect can be significantly alleviated through the modification of MoO42− in the reconstructed strain induced crystalline-amorphous nanoarchitectures, which optimizes the adsorption and dissociation energies of H2O. As a result, the NiMoO4@NCZ-LDH electrode not only exhibits excellent capacity and durability, but also significantly increases capacity retention from 21.3 % to 79.7 % after self-discharge for 72 h and keeps in a high open circuit potential throughout.

Hence, the plastic deformation behavior and microstructure evolution of 5052 aluminum alloy in electromagnetic driven stamping (EMDS) and QS under different heat treatment conditions were investigated in this paper. Compared with QS, EMDS can respectively improve the strength and plasticity of 5052-O aluminum alloy by 0.9% and 12%, as well as 4.6% and 30% in 5052-H32 state. The enhancement effect of EMDS on 5052-H32 aluminum alloy is more obvious. This is due to the 5052-H32 aluminum alloy has more initial dislocations, which will promotes multi-system slip and cross-slip of dislocation at high strain rates. Microscopic analysis indicates that the 5052-H32 aluminum alloy in EMDS possessed a more uniform dislocation distribution and a higher grain refinement degree. For a higher forming height, the grain boundary, dislocation and texture exhibit more obvious effects on the strength of the materials. It provides a theoretical basis for the forming mechanism of 5052 aluminum alloy during EMDS under different heat treatment conditions.",

It determines the extent to which they will benefit from treatment. Molecular-based analysis to detect molecular alterations in tumor tissue has become an important component of clinical care for patients with lung cancer [12,13]. High-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows rapid detection of multiple genetic mutations but is expensive, and clinical implementation remains limited in some regions. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing relies on pathologists’ visual inspection of histopathological sections and is very time-consuming. The acquisition of tissue samples is invasive (biopsy or surgery) and can suffer from molecular sampling heterogeneity and patient discomfort. In addition, re-biopsy is the primary method for determining secondary resistance [14], but it is still being determined when such an examination will be performed. Therefore, highthroughput, non-invasive longitudinal methods capable of predicting multiple gene mutation status and immune status are a critical need. Medical imaging is an integral part of cancer care and has a wide range of applications in early screening, tumor diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment planning, and disease recurrence [15,16]. Radiological imaging is assumed to reflect not only the macroscopic properties of tumors but also a wealth of information regarding tumor phenotypes, describing tissues’ cellular and molecular properties in-depth. The approach of exploring new biomarkers describing underlying biological processes from mineable high-dimensional image data is known as radiomics. It has been widely adopted as a tool to gain insight into tumor biology for various cancer types, improve patient diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately achieve better clinical outcomes [17]. This emerging approach complements biopsy by providing additional information about the spatial heterogeneity of tumors and the genetic and molecular characterization of their microenvironment. Furthermore, the non-invasive nature of radiomics facilitates the assessment of disease evolution longitudinally throughout the treatment process. The validation of the hypothesis that certain radiological phenotypes are associated with tumor gene expression patterns and immune phenotypes has been confirmed in various cancer types. However, earlier studies mainly focused on assessing the mutational status of one or two genes in a given tumor or the response to PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, which neglected the clinical need to evaluate multiple gene mutations [1,6,13]. This approach is understandable, given the epidemiological and surgical limitations that result in each disease having its own relatively common actionable mutations, such as EGFR mutations in lung cancer and BRCA mutations in breast cancer. In a single-center study, EGFR, KRAS, ERBB2, and TP53 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer were evaluated using radiomic features [5]. However, the experiment was relatively simple, and the cohort size was small. Similarly, there have been few radiomic analyses for both immunotherapy and targeted therapies. A recent publication evaluated the predictive utility of deep learning-based image features for multiple gene mutation status and PDL1 expression status in NSCLC [5]. However, this study lacked external validation and interpretability. An approach that integrates crossgenotype and immune molecule expression may lead to identifying novel biomarkers that reflect the characteristics of targeted and immune-related molecules. This would be clinically beneficial for a larger patient population. Designing radiomics studies with clinical endpoints involves careful consideration of multiple factors. On the one hand, radiomic features can be extracted from a single cross-sectional layer with the largest lesion area or a tumor volume involving all layers. Most studies employ radiomic analysis on 3D regions of the tumor, which intuitively contain more information about the tumor [18,19]. However, a subset of studies has shown that the performance of 2D modalities is comparable to that of 3D modalities [20,21], or a combination of both can improve predictive power [22,23]. The quantification of tumor phenotypes by these two modalities remains an ongoing disagreement that requires further in-depth discussion. On the other hand, radiomics research has mainly focused on the intratumoral region. Recently, radiomic features obtained from the peritumoral region have been shown to predict different cancer phenotypes [4,24,25], as these features may provide critical but easily overlooked information. Little is known about the role of peritumoral radiomic features. There is a need for a comprehensive analysis of intratumoral and peritumoral regions to assess their role. To our knowledge, no studies have attempted to use radiomics to simultaneously predict multiple genetic mutations and immune phenotypes in NSCLC patients. There is also a lack of studies on the integrated assessment of intratumoral 2D and 3D regions and peritumoral regions in cancer treatment. These research gaps demonstrate the need for further studies to provide more comprehensive and accurate information to improve patient outcomes. Our study aims to develop and validate radiomic features associated with immune and targeted molecular signatures in NSCLC patients. We evaluated the predictive power of multiscale radiomic features for six gene mutation statuses and PD-1/PD-L1 expression status based on multidimensional regions within and around the tumor. In addition, we established radiological interpretation and feature stratification of critical features and evaluated the variability of the model for different voxel spatial resolutions. Our goal is to identify new, non-invasive predictors of cancer treatment that can be used longitudinally",

Herein, we investigate the relationship between cation transports and capacitance behavior under different potential windows. In addition, we uncover intercalation mechanisms for Liþ, Naþ, and Kþ-containing electrolytes. As a result, we found that capacitive intercalation mechanism of characteristic cation can be inﬂuenced by different potential windows. Importantly, after 5000 charge-discharge cycles from ?1 V to 0 V, the cationintercalation behavior is demonstrated by signiﬁcant electrode expansion in LiCl, NaCl, and KCl electrolytes with the increased d-spacing of 1.344 nm, 1.313 nm, and 1.305 nm, respectively. Additionally, larger size of Kþ with fast ion transport is involved in fast electrochemical surface adsorptions, which explains higher capacitance of 346 F cm?3 in KCl than 218 F cm?3 in NaCl electrolyte. In contrast, small ion size of Liþ is vulnerable to adsorb and permeate the spacing between layers of Ti 3C2 T x MXene electrode, which delivers volumetric capacitance of 320 F cm?3 .

To predict bulk hardness without the indentation size effect in heavy-ion irradiated materials, this study designed a modified Nix–Gao model incorporating the effect of irradiation hardening. The model was used to determine the bulk hardness of irradiated film and unirradiated substrate in tempered F82H martensitic steel irradiated with 10.5 MeV Fe-ion. The bulk hardness of unirradiated F82H predicted from the nanoindentation hardness was consistent with the traditional Vickers hardness obtained using a multiscale hardness relationship. The effects of irradiation conditions and the irradiation damage gradient were also determined by the modified model. In a micropillar compression test performed using micropillars with sizes of 1–8 μm, the flow stress at 8 % plastic strain of the micropillars showed a stable and comparable value with that of a bulk tensile specimen, while the yield stress at 0.2 % strain offset decreased with decreasing pillar sizes. The irradiation hardening calculated using the bulk hardness obtained in the nanoindentation tests and the flow stress determined from the micropillar compression tests at 8 % plastic strain were consistent, as predicted by Tabor's law. These findings prove that the proposed method is effective for assessing the mechanical characteristics of a size-limited region, even on the subsurface of metallic materials exposed to heavy-ion irradiation.",

The experimental results reveal that SCS-TENGs yield better performance than Z-TENGs in terms of voltage, power, and power density under the same total contact area. Z-TENGs show energy loss during the transfer of mechanical energy, and such loss is aggravated by the increasing number of units.

This study presents a machine-learning strategy capable of evaluating the effect of the heat treatment process on the creep performance of superalloys and predicting creep rupture life with high accuracy. This approach integrates classification and regression models with domain-specific knowledge. The physical constraints lead to significantly enhanced prediction accuracy of the classification and regression models. Moreover, the heat treatment process is evaluated as the most important descriptor by integrating machine learning with superalloy creep theory. The heat treatment design of Waspaloy alloy is used as the experimental validation. The improved heat treatment leads to a significant enhancement in creep performance (5.5 times higher than the previous study). The research provides novel insights for enhancing the precision of predicting creep rupture life in superalloys, with the potential to broaden its applicability to the study of the effects of heat treatment processes on other properties.

However, the dearth of appropriate photosensitive semiconductors in the infrared region and the lack of suitably efficient device architecture for the separation and collection of photocarriers significantly impede the development of ultra-broadband and polarization-sensitive photodetectors. To address these challenges, a sandwiched Ta2NiSe5/MoTe2/Graphene heterostructure device is engineered. In this device, efficient and polarization-sensitive photocarriers are generated in the top Ta2NiSe5 layer, rapidly separated through the middle MoTe2 layer, and effectively collected by the bottom graphene layer. As a result, the developed photodetector exhibits an ultra-broadband and polarization-sensitive photoresponse that extends from visible light (520 nm) to short-wave infrared (2200 nm). At 2200 nm, the device displays a notable responsivity of 5.79 A W−1, a specific detectivity of 1010 Jones, and an anisotropic ratio of 1.44.

Two international consensus position statements have called for a change of name to “metabolic associated fatty liver disease” (MAFLD). 11,12 Unlike NAFLD, which is based on the exclusion of other etiologies of fatty liver, the diagnosis of MAFLD is a positive inclusion that correlates with the metabolic risk proﬁle of the patient. 13 The current consensus describes MAFLD as a multisystem disorder with the presence of hepatic steatosis and 1 of the 3 features including: (1) overweight or obesity, (2) type 2 diabetes mellitus, or (3) lean or normal weight with evidence of metabolic dysregulation. 14 Although the proposed change in Deﬁnition appears subtle, the resultant effect can have major implications that can affect our current understanding of prevalence and risk factors.

For smaller infringements there’s a lot more focus in the society on community service than there is on fines, after all fines really only affect rich folk. There are different tiers to community service though based on how important the work is and how few people there are to do it. You can pick what you want to do. Some people don’t have a lot of skills or they do and they pick something easy and end up doing a bunch of manual labor. Others do data entry. The work that pays the best is those mime work. Not everyone is suited for it. Looks and activity and age all matter. But for those that fit the skill well, few things pay better. Lots of eligible people would rather sign up for an afternoon of work rather than suffer through a week picking up trash at the side of the road. Not everyone is suited for it and mime work can be emotionally and physically exhaustive. you can always tap out. Everyone makes sure you can get out but if you do, you get zero credit. So this story is about two friends who were in trouble for using ai for plagiarism in one of their college courses. They signed up together and when they were looking through the jobs on their personal devices they both laughed at first. How hilarious is it that they both scored so high on the mime service. Neither of them had been a mime. Well not professionally. They’d both done mime stuff just for fun. Little bit here and there and never in public. The idea seemed so humiliating and they talk about it a bit. One girl had a friend who did it and they assigned her in an other town and no one knew until she started telling people herself. She was proud, apparently that she got the rumors going herself, or at least that’s what she said. so the two friends were looking at the different options for being a mime. They could mime privately once for a single person over the course of an entire week. They could do hand miming for patients at the hospital and senior center. But that was for three shifts of four hours. There were so many options. They could even spend one six hour shift miming at a women’s only mime club. They considered that even though neither of them had performed for women and weren’t interested in trying it. But the two friends were fans of the easy way out and there was an opening at the central square in Waterford, about thirty minutes away. It was government run place for mimes. They’d seen it and even known some seniors at their high school who said they went there all the time and it was expensive but worth it. But this gig was different. They would be performing in the kiosk. It was almost like an atm booth. Lots and lots of turnover. They had all seen it. It was a separate door and there was usually short line outside but the people came and went so the line never got too long. It was mostly men on their way home who wanted to see a quick mime show. it was into the kiosk and back out. So if the two friends each signed up for that it was only two hours of service each. They weren’t sure how long it would take for each person to see them mime. One of the friends assumed it would probably be four or five per hours because people must take a bit before they were done watching. so the girls sign up. The day of thought they are told something a little scary. Everyone in line watches. Some people like watching others watch a mime show. One of the friends brothers knew how it worked and they admitted going to a few times. Everyone only had five minutes to watch but that’s usually all they ever needed because there was a special mime makeup they could apply to themselves before stepping up for their turn to see the show themselves. When wearing that themselves it always went faster. the friend had to call to arrange a time when they could go together but they found out they would be at two different stations in the same “gallery” as it was called. the day of they arrived a little late so they missed half of the orientation but said it was fine. One of them covered for the other, saying they had been there before and knew the drill. That wasn’t a great idea. They were brought to their mime stations and locked into place. It was punitive miming so they weren’t shocked they had to mime in a stockade but they did anyway. The bulk of the story is a description of each of the men (and a couple women actually) who visited. It’s important to always look your best when being a mime so there was a hose and a pump dispenser with makeup there. It was a strange makeup though and both of the women found that it tingled a bit but the makeup from the dispenser actually felt nice. Which was good because the perfances themselves were exhausting and they never stopped comming. The bulk of the story is made of details of the individual encounters. Then at the end they were removed, exhausted from the stockage and placed in an after show lounge where they decompressed for a bit and shared stories. They ended up performing for each other because they were worked up from performing as a mime for everyone else. Then the story ends."

Technology had reached new heights, integrating itself into the very fabric of society. The focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment was a testament to the progress humanity had made. Yet, beneath the surface of this seemingly utopian world, there existed darker truths and intricate complexities.\n\nIn a small, seemingly ordinary college town, two friends, Sarah and Emily, found themselves caught in the tangled web of this futuristic society. They had been accused of using an AI program to plagiarize their college coursework—a minor offense in the grand scheme of things, but one that would nevertheless introduce them to a world they had never before imagined.\n\nThe once-harsh legal system had given way to a more empathetic approach, one that sought to better the individual and the community. Fines were a relic of the past, replaced by an emphasis on community service. The AI-driven society had devised a clever system, able to assess an individual's skills and talents with unnerving accuracy. The system would then assign tasks tailored to each person's abilities, ensuring maximum benefit for both the individual and the community.\n\nBut nothing in this world was ever as simple as it seemed. The community service system was tiered, with certain tasks deemed more important or demanding than others. Some were manual labor, while others required intellectual prowess. But then there were those tasks that occupied a strange, liminal space—tasks that were at once coveted and stigmatized.\n\nAnd it was into this gray area that Sarah and Emily would soon be thrust, their fates determined by a quick AI assessment and a brief, cold body scan. Little did they know that their lives were about to take a dramatic, unsettling turn. For in this futuristic society, the line between redemption and punishment was as thin as a razor's edge, and the shadows cast by progress hid secrets that would change them forever."

The cold glare of fluorescent lights reflected off the metal surfaces, casting an eerie glow. Their hearts pounded in unison as they waited for their AI assessment results, the silence between them like a living entity.\n\nThe AI, an unblinking mechanical eye in the center of the room, regarded them with a calculated indifference. When the results finally appeared on a transparent screen, the friends exchanged incredulous glances. According to the AI's analysis, they both possessed a high aptitude for...mime work.\n\nMime work? It seemed almost laughable. They had never been professional mimes, had never even considered it. Sure, they'd dabbled in it for fun, mimicking trapped-in-a-box routines or pretending to pull invisible ropes. But to perform as mimes for community service? The absurdity was almost too much.\n\nYet, as they scrolled through the AI's explanation, the friends discovered that mime work was considered a rare and valuable skill. It was a performance art that could evoke powerful emotions and reach into the depths of the human soul. And it was precisely this potency that made mime work both coveted and stigmatized.\n\nSarah and Emily felt the weight of their new roles settling upon them, a mixture of dread and fascination. They couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead as they embarked on this strange and unexpected journey. What secrets lurked in the shadows of this art form, whispered only among those who dared to tread its mysterious path?\n\nThe friends exchanged nervous smiles, knowing that they were about to enter a world that defied the ordinary. The line between reality and illusion would blur, and the boundaries of their own identities would be tested. For in the realm of mime work, silence was not just golden; it was a key that unlocked the very essence of human experience."

The AI provided them with a vast array of choices, each tailored to their newfound talents, and each designed to serve the community in different ways.\n\nOne choice involved performing privately for a single individual over the course of an entire week. The idea of such an intimate and intense connection with a stranger was both intriguing and unsettling. Another option was to offer hand miming at hospitals and senior centers, bringing silent solace to those in pain or nearing the end of their journey. The thought of providing comfort to those in need tugged at their heartstrings, but the emotional burden was undeniable.\n\nAnd then there were the more unusual choices, such as a women's only mime club or a public performance at Waterford's central square. Each possibility whispered its own secrets, promising experiences that would change them in ways they could hardly fathom.\n\nAfter hours of deliberation, they finally made their decision. They would sign up for a two-hour shift at a government-run mime kiosk in the central square of Waterford. It was a place they had passed by countless times, yet never truly noticed—a small, unassuming stage that seemed to defy the very fabric of the world around it.\n\nThe choice was not without its risks, but it was one that they felt drawn to, as if guided by forces beyond their understanding. Their hearts raced at the thought of performing in the public eye, their every movement a silent story that would speak to the souls of the onlookers.\n\nBut beneath the excitement and anticipation, Sarah and Emily couldn't shake the feeling that their decision would have consequences they could not yet foresee. As they prepared to embark on this journey into the heart of silence, they couldn't help but wonder if the shadows that lurked within the world of mime work would ultimately consume them, or if they would emerge forever changed, their souls forever bound to the art of silence."

The friends stood before the mirror, their faces a reflection of anxiety and resolve. Today, they would step into the world of mime, their silent artistry bared for all to see.\n\nArriving at the government-run mime kiosk, they were greeted by a stern-faced official who led them to separate preparation rooms. The realization that they would be performing at separate stations in the same \"gallery\" filled them with a sense of vulnerability, like a sudden gust of wind snuffing out a candle's flame.\n\nAs they donned their costumes, an unexpected announcement sent a shiver down their spines: everyone in line would watch their performances, some taking pleasure in observing others as they watched the silent show. It was a revelation that added a layer of unease to their already fragile confidence.\n\nSarah and Emily exchanged one final glance of reassurance before they were led to their stations. But fate had one more cruel twist in store: their tardiness had caused them to miss part of the orientation, leaving them in the dark about crucial aspects of the process. They tried to brush off their concerns, telling themselves they could handle whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\nAs they stepped onto the small stages and locked eyes with their audience, Sarah and Emily felt a shudder ripple through them, as if the boundary between reality and illusion had begun to blur. The weight of expectation pressed down upon them like a leaden shroud, and they knew that there was no turning back. They had entered the realm of mime, a world where silence was the only language, and the shadows of the unknown whispered dark secrets that only the brave dared to face."

They became trapped birds yearning for freedom, lost souls navigating the endless labyrinth of life, and lonely travelers on a journey to find meaning in a vast and empty universe.\n\nTheir audience, a sea of faces both enraptured and judgmental, seemed to fade into the background as the two friends found themselves lost in the world of their creation. Each movement, each gesture, carried with it a weight and significance that transcended time and space.\n\nBut the performance was not without its challenges. The mime makeup they applied tingled on their skin, a strange and unnerving sensation that seemed to heighten their awareness of every touch and sensation. And their exhaustion grew with each passing moment, their bodies aching from the strain of maintaining their silent artistry.\n\nAs the hours ticked by, Sarah and Emily fought to maintain their focus, their minds beginning to fray at the edges. The line between reality and illusion grew ever thinner, and they could feel the darkness that lurked within the world of mime work, whispering its secrets and threatening to consume them whole.\n\nFinally, the performances came to an end, and the friends were led to an after-show lounge, where they could decompress and recover from the intensity of their experience. As they shared stories of their individual encounters with the audience, they found themselves overcome by an inexplicable desire to perform for each other, as if the act of miming had become an essential part of who they were.\n\nIn that moment, as they moved in silent harmony, Sarah and Emily realized that their foray into the world of mime work had changed them forever. They had glimpsed the shadows that dwelled within the art of silence, and in doing so, had unlocked a part of themselves they never knew existed.

But they could not shake the feeling that something had followed them from the shadowy realm of mime work, a lingering presence that haunted their every thought.\n\nLate one evening, as they sat together in the dimly lit confines of Emily's apartment, they began to share their suspicions with one another. The words poured forth like water from a broken dam, a torrent of unspoken fears and doubts.\n\n\"I can't shake the feeling that...something's still with me,\" Sarah confessed, her voice barely a whisper. \"It's like a shadow that's always just out of the corner of my eye.\"\n\nEmily nodded, her eyes wide with understanding. \"I know what you mean. It's like...we brought something back with us from the world of mime work. Something that won't let us go.\"\n\nAs they spoke, a chilling realization began to take shape in their minds. The darkness that had haunted the realm of mime work, the shadows that whispered their secrets and threatened to consume them, had somehow seeped into their lives, a malevolent force that refused to be banished.\n\nTogether, they resolved to confront the darkness, to delve once more into the world of mime work and face the shadows that dwelled within.

The building loomed before them like a silent, judgmental sentinel as they hesitantly approached.\n\nAs they entered the dimly lit building, the memories of their performances flooded back, as vivid and intense as the day they had first stepped onto the stage. The air felt heavy with anticipation and dread, a palpable presence that seemed to cling to them like a second skin.\n\nTheir plan was to perform again, hoping that by facing the darkness head-on, they could banish it from their lives forever. They stood side by side, hands trembling as they applied the mime makeup that had once tingled on their skin. As they looked into each other's eyes, they drew strength from their shared resolve.\n\nThe performance began, and the two friends felt the familiar rush of adrenaline and fear as they danced in the shadows of the kiosk. They moved with a newfound purpose, their bodies weaving a silent story of defiance and courage in the face of the darkness that sought to consume them.\n\nAs they danced, Sarah and Emily felt a growing awareness of the sinister presence that lurked within the world of mime work. It seemed to surround them, toying with them like a predator stalking its prey. But the friends refused to yield to fear, their movements growing bolder and more determined as they faced the shadows head-on.\n\nAs the performance reached its climax, Sarah and Emily felt a sudden surge of power, a wave of energy that seemed to radiate from their very souls. They channeled this newfound strength into their performance, their silent artistry becoming a weapon against the darkness that sought to claim them.\n\nIn that moment, a brilliant flash of light pierced the gloom, and the shadows that had haunted them seemed to dissipate like smoke in the wind. The darkness that had clung to their lives had been vanquished, banished by the power of their performance and the strength of their resolve.\n\nBreathless and exhausted, Sarah and Emily embraced, tears of relief streaming down their faces. They had faced the darkness that dwelled within the world of mime work and emerged victorious, their bond stronger than ever.\n\nAs they left the kiosk, the sun broke through the clouds, bathing the world in a golden light. The shadows of the past had been left behind, replaced by the promise of a brighter future. They knew that their lives would never be the same, that the power of silence would forever be a part of them.

The world around them seemed somehow less vibrant, less alive than it had before, as if the act of confronting the darkness had forever altered the very fabric of reality.\n\nYet, despite the lingering sense of unease that haunted them, the two friends found solace in the knowledge that they had faced their fears and emerged stronger for it. The bond they had forged in the heart of silence had proven unbreakable, a testament to the power of friendship and the strength of the human spirit.\n\nAs time passed, Sarah and Emily began to explore the world of mime work once more, drawn to the artistry and the secrets that lay hidden within. They approached their craft with a newfound respect and caution, aware of the shadows that lurked just beyond the edges of their vision.\n\nSlowly, they began to unlock the true potential of their talents, using their skills to bring joy and wonder to the lives of those around them. And as they did so, they discovered that the darkness they had faced was not an enemy to be vanquished, but a part of themselves that had to be accepted and embraced.\n\nFor in the world of mime work, they had found not just a source of power and darkness, but a means of healing and redemption. And as they walked the line between shadow and light, Sarah and Emily knew that they had found their true calling, a purpose that transcended the boundaries of silence and spoke to the very core of their souls."

His gaze pierces through her, and she feels exposed, vulnerable. He's so close, so near. Why am I here? Why am I doing this? She wonders, but there's no time for second thoughts, for doubts or regrets. She's a mime, locked in this world of silence, and she must perform.\n\nHer hands begin to move, delicate, weaving an invisible web of stories and emotions. The man's eyes follow her every gesture, his breath hot and heavy on her neck. The air is thick with anticipation, and she feels a shiver run down her spine. What does he want from me? What does he see when he looks at me? She asks herself, her thoughts racing like a torrent of water through her mind.\n\nWith each movement, each silent story, she feels a part of herself slipping away, dissolving into the shadows that surround her. She wants to scream, to cry out for help, but she knows she can't. The silence has her trapped, bound in invisible chains that tighten with every breath she takes.\n\nThe man leans closer, his lips curling into a twisted smile as he watches her perform. She can see the darkness in his eyes, the hunger that drives him, and she knows that she must give him what he wants. But the fear is consuming her, burning her from the inside out like a wildfire.\n\nStill, she dances, her body moving in fluid, graceful arcs, the silent stories spilling from her fingertips like droplets of water. She feels as if she's drowning, suffocating in the silence that surrounds her. But she knows that she must continue, that she cannot escape the invisible prison that holds her captive.\n\nAnd as the man watches, as the shadows dance and flicker around her, she wonders if she will ever find a way to break free, to escape the darkness that binds her. Or if she is forever trapped, a prisoner in a world of silence, her soul forever entwined in the suffocating embrace of the shadows."

The thermodynamic allosteric switch was ingeniously customized as a hairpin probe (HP) that was in dynamic equilibrium but rapidly interconverting conformations. At the “inactive state”, the MITF-binding region and the switch part were “sequestered”. Upon the introduction of MITF, an MITF-HP complex promptly formed, and the equilibrium of HP thermodynamically inclined from the “inactive state” toward the “active state” conformation. Immediately, the exposed switch on HP effectively actuated the 3D DNA nanomachine and synchronously produced the restriction site for Nb.BbvCI nicking endonuclease. After the autonomous conveying of the 3D DNA nanomachine by means of the high-efficiency circularly nicking endonuclease signal amplification (NESA), not only was MB-S1 in the supernatant used for FL measurements but also MB-SP/MNs/S2 in the precipitate was adapted for EC analysis, significantly improving the utilization of output products derived from the 3D DNA nanomachine.

The two hexahydrates are isostructural, containing isolated PtX6 octahedra separated by Na cations. Removal of the water results in the formation of the anhydrous vacancy ordered double perovskites Na2PtX6. The Na cation is too small for the cuboctahedron site of the parent cubic structure, resulting in cooperative tilting of the PtX6 octahedra and lowering of the symmetry. Replacing Na with a larger alkali metal (K, Rb, or Cs) invariably enabled the isolation of the anhydrous hexahalide, and we found no evidence that these readily hydrated. For all cations, other than Na, it was possible to observe the archetypical cubic structure, although for the two potassium salts K2PtBr6 and K2PtI6, this was only observed above a critical temperature of 175 and 460 K, respectively. As these two samples were cooled,  symmetry lowering was observed, yielding a tetragonal structure initially and ultimately a monoclinic structure: Fm3̅m → P4/mnc → P21/n.

The CLF and CBF respectively characterize the stability objective and the safety objective for the nonlinear control systems. These objectives imply important properties including controllability, convergence, and robustness of control problems. Under this framework, optimal control corresponds to the minimal solution to a constrained QP problem. When uncertainties are explicitly considered, the setting of the CLF and CBF is proposed to study the input-to-state stability and input-to-state safety and to analyze the effect of disturbances.

Although the heteroepitaxial growth of Ge0.75Sn0.25 on InP has been reported, the basic physical properties of Ge0.75Sn0.25 have not yet been clarified. In this study, we discuss three topics: (1) understanding the crystalline growth features of Ge0.75Sn0.25 on InP, (2) revealing the thermal stability of Ge0.75Sn0.25, and (3) developing a carrier-control technique. First, we found that a low-temperature molecular beam epitaxy could achieve a Ge0.75Sn0.25 layer with superior crystallinity without dislocations. However, low Sn-content Ge1−xSnx regions are locally formed during the Ge0.75Sn0.25 heteroepitaxy; the origins of the low Sn-content Ge1−xSnx regions were discussed by transmission electron microscopy analysis. In addition, we found that lowering the growth temperature from 100 °C to 70 °C also effectively reduces the area of the low Sn-content Ge1−xSnx regions. Next, we found that Ge0.75Sn0.25 layers grown at 70 °C sustain thermal stability up to 200 °C without causing crystalline degradations. Finally, we demonstrated the in-situ Sb doping to Ge0.75Sn0.25. We found that the undoped and in-situ Sb-doped Ge0.75Sn0.25 layers exhibited p-type and n-type conduction, respectively, with carrier concentrations of order 1019 cm−3 by Hall effect measurement.

                "value": "Résume moi cet article : \nYou might have heard about LLaMa or maybe you haven’t. Either way, what’s the big deal? It’s just some AI thing. In a nutshell, LLaMa is important because it allows you to run large language models (LLM) like GPT-3 on commodity hardware. In many ways, this is a bit like Stable Diffusion, which similarly allowed normal folks to run image generation models on their own hardware with access to the underlying source code. We’ve discussed why Stable Diffusion matters and even talked about how it works.\n\nLLaMa is a transformer language model from Facebook/Meta research, which is a collection of large models from 7 billion to 65 billion parameters trained on publicly available datasets. Their research paper showed that the 13B version outperformed GPT-3 in most benchmarks and LLama-65B is right up there with the best of them. LLaMa was unique as inference could be run on a single GPU due to some optimizations made to the transformer itself and the model being about 10x smaller. While Meta recommended that users have at least 10 GB of VRAM to run inference on the larger models, that’s a huge step from the 80 GB A100 cards that often run these models.\n\nWhile this was an important step forward for the research community, it became a huge one for the hacker community when [Georgi Gerganov] rolled in. He released llama.cpp on GitHub, which runs the inference of a LLaMa model with 4-bit quantization. His code was focused on running LLaMa-7B on your Macbook, but we’ve seen versions running on smartphones and Raspberry Pis. There’s even a version written in Rust! A rough rule of thumb is anything with more than 4 GB of RAM can run LLaMa. Model weights are available through Meta with some rather strict terms, but they’ve been leaked online and can be found even in a pull request on the GitHub repo itself.\n\nAside from occasionally funny and quirky projects, how does having a local GPT-3 like chatbot impact us? The simple fact is that it is accessible to hackers. Not only can you run it, but the code is available, the models are trained on publicly available data, so you could train your own though it took 21 days on 2048 A100 GPUs, and it’s useful enough to provide reasonable output. Stanford even released a version called Alpaca that is LLaMa-7B fine-tuned for instruction following which elevates it from a simple chatbot to a bot able to follow instructions. There is even a guide on how to replicate Alpaca yourself for less than $100 of cloud computing.\n\nOf course, like most current LLMs, LLaMa suffers from the same problems of hallucination, bias, and stereotypes. When asked to generate code, it can try to request endpoints that don’t exist. When asked what the capital of Tanzania is, it will reply Dar es Salaam instead of Dodoma. Researchers haven’t solved the problem of trying to secure a black box, as it is still far too easy to get the model to do something its creators tried hard to prevent.\n\nWhile it is incredible to think that just a few weeks ago it would have been ridiculous to think you could run a GPT-3 level model on your personal laptop, this ultimately asks the question: what will we do with this? The easy answer is sophisticated spam. Long term there are concerns that large language models could replace programmers and writers. For writing or tweaking small programs, it is already quite good as [Simon Wilson] demonstrated by asking it to generate some AppleScript. However, that is still up for debate. Being able to spit out an accurate answer to a question does not a human make. What do you do with the raw sort of bias-confused amorphous intelligence that is ChatGPT and other LLMs now running locally?\n\nRather than connecting to an API, the Raspberry Pi inside of this old typewriter can run it entirely locally with no internet connection required. Because the model is smaller, it becomes much easier to fine-tune for your use case. By taking a bunch of dialog from a TV show (let’s say the Simpsons) you could fine-tune the model to respond like a character from the show. Looking further into the future, there is an excellent paper called ReAct that tries to put something like an internal dialog into chat GPT by asking it to output questions, thoughts, and actions. A good example might be this:\n\nQuestion: How much bigger is the land in Seattle, Washington versus the water?\nThought: I need to use Wikipedia to look up the square footage of the city area and the water\nAction: search\\_wikipedia: Seattle, WA\nObservation:\n• City 142.07 sq mi (367.97 km2)\n• Land 83.99 sq mi (217.54 km2)\n• Water 58.08 sq mi (150.43 km2)\n• Metro 8,186 sq mi (21,202 km2)\nThought: The city is 142.07 square miles and the water is 58.08 square miles, I should calculate a ratio.\nAction: calculate: 142.07 / 58.08\nObservation: 2.4461\nAnswer: The land is 2.4x the size of the water or 83.99 square miles bigger\n\nYou can see how this forms a loop where complex actions can be broken down to be performed by simplified helpers, like searching Wikipedia, calling APIs, controlling smart appliances, or actuating motors. Google has been experimenting with the concept in their PaLM-SayCan system, which uses an LLM (PaLM) and breaks it down into smaller tasks.\n\nWe can see LLaMa powering NPCs in video games, optimizing blog titles, and controlling robots. So understandably, we’re quite curious to see what you all do with it. One thing is for sure, though. Putting this in the hands of creative hackers is going to be fun."

Medium and oxygen diffusion capability of all hydrogels showed they are suitable for 3D cell cultures. Mechanical and structural changes of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) on hydrogels were compared with cells on standard cultivation surfaces. Experiments showed that hydrogels have suitable mechanical and cell adhesion capabilities, resulting in structural changes of actin filaments.

For example, Xiaoxia Guo, et al. found that ionized Li+ from LiCl additive can form a protective layer of Li2O/Li2CO3 on Zn surface to suppress dendritic deposition. The Zn ions diffuse along the [010] crystal face, and the insulating protective layer restricts the reduction of zinc ions to only occur when they are in close proximity to the surface, rather than accumulating at the high-charge density tip. Further, different anions were also studied and it was concluded that the Cl? ions in the electrolyte play a key role in decreasing the polarization and increasing the ion transport [27]. Longsheng Cao, et al. introduced 0.05 M SnCl2 additive into eutectic 7.6 M ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte to form a zincophilic Sn bottom layer through replacement reaction, and a dense zincophobic Zn5(OH)8Cl2⋅H2O top layer to suppress water decomposition and Zn dendrite growth (Fig. 3c) [28].

However, serious issues regarding cycle stability still remain when matching with conventional non-aqueous carbonate electrolytes that contain fluorine such as lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6). Hydrolysis of LiPF6 generates corrosive hydrofluoric acid (HF), which destroys the cathode structure and accelerates the cathodic dissolution/anodic deposition of transition metal (TM) ions. Here, we demonstrate that ball milling NCM811 with carbon-coated aluminum nitride (AlN-C) remarkably enhances the capacity retention. AlN-C acts both as a scavenger and as an adsorption center to digest and adsorb H2O and HF, respectively. Thereby, it prevents the dissolution of TM ions, which would result in capacity decay and damage to the lithium metal anode. It is demonstrated that the addition of AlN-C via wet ball milling with NCM811 enables retaining a specific capacity of 149.9 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles (capacity retention: 85.2 %) at 1 C even in a high moisture electrolyte containing ∼0.2 % (v/v) H2O.

A skip layer is developed by HyperNet [37] to fuse features from multiple levels, which contributes significantly to the detection performance of small objects. Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) [38] introduces dilated convolution layer with different dilation factors to capture low-level location information. Feature pyramid network (FPN) [39], a classical feature fusion method in deep learning (DL)-based CV, incorporates a top-down path to fuse features at each level. Due to the superior performance of FPN, many FPN variants have been proposed for diverse scenarios, such as PANet [40], Bi-FPN [34], AFPN [41], ABFPN [42], and DCIFPN [43]. All these variants optimize the fusion path of the FPN in various ways. Considering the influence of similar defects and densely distributed defects in weld inspection, not only the low-level detail features need to be strengthened for the discrimination of similar features, but also the high-level positioning features need to be strengthened to highlight the edges of adjacently distributed defects. Therefore, it is necessary to design a module to fully strengthen the low-level and high-level features.",

To investigate the influence of laser parameters and crystal orientation on the recast layer potential formation thickness at the atomic scale, a molecular dynamics model of laser irradiation sapphire crystal was constructed. Experiments of laser-induced recast layer formation were carried out, and the effects of laser fluence, pulse width, and wavelength on the surface recast layer were analyzed. The results show that the ejected atom start formation time is significantly influenced by pulse width, while the potential formation thickness of the recast layer is mainly influenced by the deposited laser energy. Moreover, under the same laser energy, the damage extent in sapphire crystal caused by laser irradiation along the (0001) orientation is significantly weaker compared to irradiation along the (1–100) and (11–20) orientations.

The ECD process serves as a useful approach for controlling the growth and characteristics of these HA coatings. Additionally, to refine the crystalline structure and bolster biocompatibility, annealing techniques were employed. The results unveiled distinctive morphologies for HA coatings under varying pH levels of the electrolyte: granular at pH 4, flake-like at pH 6, and needle-like at pH 9, emphasizing the significant impact of electrolyte pH on coating structure. Surface roughness exhibited its peak at pH 4, indicative of the most uneven HA layer formation. In particular, all HA-coated samples displayed heightened hydrophilicity compared to their uncoated CP-Ti counterparts, with pH 6 showing the most substantial decrease in contact angle, suggesting pronounced biocompatibility enhancements. X-ray Diffraction affirmed HA as the predominant phase in the annealed coatings. Electrochemical assessments were conducted to gauge the electrochemical behavior of HA-coated samples. The findings revealed that pH 6 offered the most robust electrochemical behavior, rendering it a promising electrolyte pH condition for HA-coated CP-Ti biomedical implants. This comprehensive investigation highlights the profound influence of the pH of the electrolyte on HA morphology and surface properties, which in turn impact electrochemical behavior in HA-coated CP-Ti for biomedical implant applications. As such, the application of ECD techniques across varying pH levels of the electrolyte emerges as an effective strategy for tailoring HA coatings, thus enhancing their suitability for biomedical implants.",

For instance, NGCF and LightGCN significantly outperform BPR and SBPR. This implies that the GNN is powerful in terms of representation learning for graph data because it naturally integrates node information with the topological structure. • Of the GNN-based methods considered, the model that uses social relationship information and data on user-item interactions delivers much better performance than the model that used only information on user-item interactions. For example, the MHCN, DiffNet, and SBPR outperform LightGCN and NGCF. SBPR integrates social information with BPR, whereas the MHCN is based on LightGCN, and exploits more reliable social relationship information. The improved performance of these models means that social information complements information on user-item interactions, and their joint use is beneficial for forming accurate user representations and improving recommendation performance. • The models that integrate CL with SL deliver the second-best performance. Specifically, our proposed ReACL, and SGL used CL based on SL from LightGCN, whereas the s2-MHCN used CL based on the MHCN. These three models outperform the other SL models, which indicates that CL can alleviate the problem of popularity bias due to its ability to extract self-supervised signals from unlabeled data. However, these models do not fully utilize the potential of CL because they ignore the relationship homophily among the data in the CL module. As a result, they have a limited ability to alleviate the problem of popularity bias. • Notably, our ReACL consistently outperforms all the baseline methods on all four datasets, Douban-Movie, Epinions, Last.fm, and Yelp. The maximum performance improvement is observed in the Epinions dataset. In comparison with the second-best results, our ReACL achieves the performance uplift of 5.65 %, 8.24 %, 6.69 %, 5.46 % according to the evaluation metrics Prec@10, Rec@10, F1@10, and NDCG@10, respectively. We attribute this to the fact that the proposed model ReACL fully exploits the relationship homophily among data. Concretely speaking, the ReACL performs meaningful data augmentation based on the social relationships among users and the commonality relationships among items. Thus, the ability of CL to mitigate popularity bias is improved. More J. Ji et al.",

A new paradigm shift for solving PDEs using DNNs emerged with the development of Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)[10] . PINN benefits from the performance and accuracy of automatic differentiation[11] . The inputs of the NN are space-time independent variables and the partial derivatives of the output with respect to inputs are compiled into a physics-based loss term in the form of a PDE. If available, known values of the field are included in the loss term, and initial and boundary conditions are enforced by adding corresponding terms to the loss in the form of mean squared error. The parameters of the feed forward NN are optimized by minimizing these losses. PINNs show extraordinary performance for interpolation and surrogate modeling. They have been successfully applied to solve many problems[12 18]− . However, the training of PINNs still presents challenges despite the extensive improvements by Wang et al.[19 21]− and Chen et al.[22] . Also, the convergence of PINNs can be slow for complex problems with multiple governing equations. Another issue is the extrapolation capability of PINNs. Even though PINNs are successful interpolators, their extrapolation performance is rather poor. Predicting a solution outside the training time interval gives unsatisfactory results[23] . A recent work from Lu et al.[24] introduces DeepOnets which is based on learning the underlying operators of the governing equations. Oommen et al.[25] proposed a hybrid autoencoder network to predict the time evolution of two-phase microstructures by learning the dynamics in latent space using a DeepOnet architecture. Recently, significant attention is concentrated on recurrent learning based PDE solvers because of their robustness for time-extrapolation[23, 26, 27] . One of the fundamental recurrent learning structures used for solving PDEs is Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). They are designed to capture long-time behavior of time-series inputs[28] . However, their training is challenging because of vanishing or exploding gradients[29] . Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) structure is proven to be easier to train compared to RNNs due to their ingenious gated structure[30] . However, the basic LSTM architecture is a fully-connected architecture and it does not conserve spatio-temporal dependencies. On the other hand, NNs with convolutional layers have proven to perform better on data sets with spatial dependencies and easier to train[31] . Recently, Shi et al.[32] introduced Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) architecture and demonstrated its superior performance to LSTMs for capturing data with spatio-temporal correlations. Ren et al.[23] proposed a PDE solver using ConvLSTM by employing FDM to estimate physical losses",

It is an extension of the minimax algorithm, which is a backtracking algorithm that evaluates the best possible move for a player by exploring all possible moves and their outcomes in a game tree.\n\nThe main goal of alpha-beta pruning is to reduce the number of nodes that need to be evaluated in the game tree, thus speeding up the search process without affecting the final decision.\n\nAlpha-beta pruning works by maintaining two values, alpha and beta, which represent the best possible score for the maximizing player (usually referred to as 'player A' or 'alpha') and the best possible score for the minimizing player (usually referred to as 'player B' or 'beta').\n\nAlpha starts at negative infinity, representing the worst possible score for player A, and beta starts at positive infinity, representing the worst possible score for player B. As the algorithm traverses the game tree, these values get updated with the best scores found so far for each player.\n\nThe pruning process occurs when the algorithm detects that a subtree cannot produce a better result than the current best-known scores for either player. In this case, it \"prunes\" the subtree by not exploring it further, thus saving computational resources.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of alpha-beta pruning:\n\n1. Start at the root of the game tree, with alpha set to negative infinity and beta set to positive infinity.\n2. Explore the game tree using a depth-first search, alternating between maximizing and minimizing levels.\n3. When reaching a terminal node or a maximum search depth, return the evaluation of the game state.\n4. At maximizing levels, update alpha with the maximum value found so far. If alpha is greater than or equal to beta, prune the remaining branches of the current node, as they cannot produce a better result for the maximizing player.\n5. At minimizing levels, update beta with the minimum value found so far. If beta is less than or equal to alpha, prune the remaining branches of the current node, as they cannot produce a better result for the minimizing player.\n6. Backtrack through the tree, updating alpha and beta values, and pruning branches as needed.\n7. Once the search is completed, the best move for the current player corresponds to the highest (for maximizing player) or lowest (for minimizing player) evaluation found in the explored game tree.\n\nBy pruning branches that will not affect the final decision, alpha-beta pruning allows the search algorithm to explore deeper levels of the game tree within the same time constraints, ultimately leading to better move choices and improved gameplay."

The therapeutic options have expanded substantially over the past decade with biologics (eg, antitumour necrosis factor (TNF), vedolizumab, and ustekinumab) and small molecules (eg, Janus kinase inhibitors and sphingosine-1-receptor modulators). The rapid advent of new therapies has allowed more stringent therapeutic goals to be considered, including clinical and endoscopic remission. Ongoing studies will find out whether histological healing could be the ultimate therapeutic goal. Once a treatment has been introduced, strictly monitoring patients, and performing rapid treatment escalation if the therapeutic goals have not been reached, is recommended. Despite these advances, remission rates do not surpass 20–30% in induction clinical trials and 30–60% of patients in a real-life setting. Consequently, some patients still require surgery for medically refractory disease.

The GBE process was carried out by the rolling-annealing method via two routes of low and medium applied strain, followed by a short annealing period in a single-step and iterative manner. The grain boundary character distribution was obtained by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) analysis, and the intergranular corrosion resistance and the tensile behavior of the samples were examined. Microstructural characterization showed that applying low strain repetitively increased the coincidence site lattice (CSL) and Σ3 boundaries percentage and created large twin-related domains (TRD). The reduced sensitization was attributed to a high proportion of CSLs and large-sized TRDs by applying a low-strain route. In the early stages of the low-strain route, the grain boundary character distribution showed a high number of primary twin nuclei in coarse grains and a continuous network of single twin nuclei in smaller grains, creating a high percentage of Σ3-grain boundaries. The low applied strain and the absence of the necessary driving force for the recrystallization and GBs migration led to the formation of twin nuclei, which would assist with the reduction of microstructure energy. A high percentage of Σ3 boundaries and an increase in the percentage of triple points consisting of low energy boundaries were found to be influential factors in increasing elongation.",

The sheet was treated by solution aging, and the metallographic structure and hardness of the sheet before and after heat treatment were analyzed. Results showed that the sheet with good hardness gradient distribution can be obtained by selecting appropriate process parameters. When the rotation speed of the stirring tool is 300 rpm, the feed speed of the stirring tool is 250 mm/min, the downward pressure of the stirring tool is 6.6 mm, the hardness distribution of the upper and lower surfaces and sections of the specimens with or without heat treatment improves, and the best gradient hardness distribution of the sections is obtained. The grains in the stirred region of the prepared gradient sheet obtained by each parameter are refined to a certain extent, especially after heat treatment. Grain changes are obvious, but the grains grow after heat treatment. The second phase precipitated after heat treatment is evenly distributed, and this is effect improves the hardness of the sheet. The aluminum alloy gradient material prepared in this paper can meet the requirements of the automobile industry and other molding plate performance requirements. It is also found that the friction stir joining technology can better prepare aluminum alloy gradient material, and the fabricated material has fewer defects than the continuous casting technology.",

By using state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we investigated the fundamental optoelectronic and structural traits of PH-Si. Our findings reveal that PH-Si boasts promising electronic properties characterized by anisotropic conductance and metallic behavior along specific directions. We also examine its structural and dynamic stability through phonon calculations and AIMD simulations. PH-Si structural stability was also confirmed by its low formation energy of −3.62 eV and dynamical stability at 1000 K. The material exhibits optical absorption in visible (Vis) and ultraviolet (UV) spectral regions, positioning it as a potential Vis-UV detector and absorber. Additionally, we assess its crucial mechanical attributes, encompassing elastic stiffness constants, Young’s modulus (ranging from 5 to 40 GPa), and a Poisson ratio of 0.8, collectively offering valuable insights into its mechanical performance.

In this work, the catalytic effect of metallic nickel at high temperature was used to generate hollow carbon nanofibers loaded with NiS and Ni (denoted as NiS/Ni@HCNF). The heteroatoms doped carbon fibers buffer the huge volumetric change of NiS during the discharge/charge process, and enhance the ion transport efficiency and electrical conductivity. In addition, the high specific surface area brought by the hollow carbon nanofibers can accelerate the electrolyte penetration and speed up the transport of ions as well as electrons. When used as anode of half cell, this electrode gives 958.5 and 612.9 mAh/g after running 1000 cycles under 1 and 2 A/g, showing the extremely-low attenuation rates of 0.0483 % per cycle and 0.0643 % per cycle, respectively. Impressively, NCM//NiS/Ni@HCNF battery shows the discharge capacity of 187.6 mAh/g at 1st cycle. Regarding the next 100 cycles, the relatively-high discharge capacities (&gt;110 mAh/g) and coulombic efficiency (CE) values (&gt;96 %) are discerned.

Nanoparticles appear as a valid alternative to allow a preferential accumulation in inflamed tissues following oral administration while reducing systemic drug exposure. To increase the residence time of nanoparticles in the inflamed intestine, a hybrid nanocomposite with customized properties is here developed by associating them with a hydrogel matrix. A bioadhesive peptide-based hydrogel is mixed with nanoemulsions, creating a hybrid lipid-polymer nanocomposite. Mucopenetrating nanoemulsions of 100 nm are embedded in a scaffold constituted of the self-assembling peptide hydrogel product PuraStat®. The nanocomposite is fully characterized to study the impact of lipid particles in the hydrogel structure. Rheological measurements and circular dichroism analyses are performed to investigate the system's microstructure and physical properties. Biodistribution studies demonstrate that the nanocomposite acts as a depot in the stomach and facilitates the slow release of the nanoemulsions in the intestine. Efficacy studies upon oral administration of the drug-loaded system show the improvement of the disease score in a mouse model of intestinal inflammation.This article is protected by copyright.

The nano-hardness of the coatings reduced from 9.3 GPa to 6.1 GPa with increasing annealing time to 64 h.

Their properties are dependent on their composition, material concentration, fiber density and the fabrication approaches, among other factors. The encapsulation of immune cells in this kind of hydrogels, both in absence or presence of a pathogen, represents a promising strategy for the development of platforms that mimic healthy and infected tissues, respectively. In this work, we have encapsulated macrophages in 3D hydrogels of porcine decellularized adipose matrices (pDAMs) without and with the Candida albicans fungus, as 3D experimental models to study the macrophage immunocompetence in a closer situation to the physiological conditions and to mimic an infection scenario. Our results indicate that encapsulated macrophages preserve their functionality within these pDAM hydrogels and phagocytose live pathogens. In addition, their behavior is influenced by the hydrogel pore size, inversely related to the hydrogel concentration. Thus, larger pore size promotes the polarization of macrophages towards M2 phenotype along the time and enhances their phagocytosis capability. It is important to point out that encapsulated macrophages in absence of pathogen showed an M2 phenotype, but macrophages coencapsulated with C. albicans can switch towards an M1 inflammatory phenotype to resolve the infection, depending on the fungus quantity. The present study reveals that pDAM hydrogels preserve the macrophage plasticity, demonstrating their relevance as new models for macrophage-pathogen interaction studies that mimic an infection scenario with application in regenerative medicine research.",

Among these lanthanide MOFs, MOF-76 is a noteworthy example composed of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and lanthanide ions. In this study, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (ΦPL) of 91% for Tb-based MOF-76 (Tb-MOF) is reported, while the efficiency of Eu-based MOF-76 (Eu-MOF) is over five times lower. A potential circumvention of the poor performance of Eu3+ is energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+, but it is found that although energy transfer is efficient the ΦPL of the Eu3+ remains low. The study investigates the cause of the lower quantum yield in Eu-MOF by ruling out possible factors such as crystal size, guest solvent molecules, and energy transfer from or back to the linker. None of these are significant loss mechanisms, leading to conclude that the MOF-76 ligand unfortunately leads to fast non-radiative deactivation of the Eu3+ excited state. The results suggest that MOF-76 is an excellent host for Tb3+ ions, but exploration is required for MOF linkers to simply access the potentially excellent emission efficiency of Eu3+ ions.",

The phase composition, morphology, bulk density, apparent porosity, flexural strength at room temperature, dielectric constant, and dielectric loss of the composites were all examined in relation to changing the Kovar glass content.

Commercially available infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are predominantly made of III–V materials, which are costly and not silicon-compatible. These materials suffer a degraded performance if the emitting wavelength is longer than 2.35 μm. To address this long-standing challenge, GeSn semiconductors have been proposed as versatile building blocks for silicon-integrated optoelectronic devices. In this regard, this work demonstrates LEDs consisting of a vertical PIN double heterostructure p-Ge0.94Sn0.06/i-Ge0.91Sn0.09/n-Ge0.95Sn0.05 grown epitaxially on a silicon wafer using a germanium interlayer and multiple GeSn buffer layers. The emission from these GeSn LEDs at variable diameters in the 40–120 μm range is investigated under both DC and AC operation modes. The fabricated LEDs exhibit room temperature emission in the extended short-wave range centered around 2.5 μm under an injected current density as low as 45 A/cm2. By comparing the photoluminescence and electroluminescence signals, it is demonstrated that the LED emission wavelength is not affected by the device fabrication process or heating during the LED operation. Moreover, the measured optical power was found to increase monotonically as the duty cycle increases, indicating that the DC operation yields the highest achievable optical power. The LED emission profile and bandwidth are also presented and discussed.",

Due to their unique intrinsic properties, graphene-based Fe single-atom catalysts (SACs) have gained considerable attention in electrocatalysis, while their potential for NORR and the underlying mechanism remain to be explored. Herein, using constant-potential density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigated the electrocatalytic NORR on the graphene-based Fe SACs. By changing the local coordination environment of Fe single atoms, 26 systems were constructed. Theoretical results show that, among these systems, the Fe SAC coordinated with four pyrrole N atoms and that co-coordinated with three pyridine N atoms and one O atom exhibit excellent NORR activity with low limiting potentials of −0.26 and −0.33 V, respectively, as well as have high selectivity toward NH3 by inhibiting the formation of byproducts, especially under applied potential. Furthermore, electronic structure analyses indicate that NO molecules can be effectively adsorbed and activated via the electron “donation–backdonation” mechanism. In particular, the d-band center of the Fe SACs was identified as an efficient catalytic activity descriptor for NORR. Our work could stimulate and guide the experimental exploration of graphene-based Fe SACs for efficient NORR toward NH3 under ambient conditions.",

During the annealing process of the Sn/β-Fe2O3 photoanode, Sn atoms tend to diffuse to the surface36,37 , but the Sn in the bulk is still relatively uniform (Supplementary Fig. 9). Such characteristics make the stability rise continuously at ﬁrst, then decline slowly, and ﬁnally maintain a stable range of ﬂuctuations. At the initial stage of the reaction, the β-Fe2O3 on the surface is converted into FeOOH in situ (Fig. 3). FeOOH itself is an efﬁcient electrocatalyst, so the photocurrent increased. Because of the inﬁltration corrosion of Cl− along with the excessive surface reconstruction and the loss of Sn, the photocurrent density had a downwards trend after 700 h. It can be analysed from Supplementary Fig. 10 that due to the electrocatalytic effect of surface FeOOH after the 1000-h reaction, the onset potential moved to the negative direction by approximately 0.1 VRHE. However, the photocurrent density at 1.6 VRHE was reduced with the inﬂuence of surface reconstruction and corrosion. Owing to the relatively uniform distribution of Sn in the whole ﬁlm, reconstruction, and corrosion were controlled within a certain range of the β-Fe2O3 surface instead of continuing to the deep layer. In addition, while the surface reconstruction was accompanied by the loss of Sn, there would also be a sedimentation equilibrium on the surface, and deposition would occur, which forms a dynamic balance of corrosion, metal loss, deposition, and protection. A dynamic stable state of surface evolution was established after a period of time, so the photocurrent density tended to be stable after 1000 h. In contrast, we covered a layer of efﬁcient OER electrocatalyst CoFe-LDH on the surface of Sn/β-Fe2O3 as a protective passivation layer. However, a signiﬁcant downwards trend of the photocurrent was observed in the ﬁrst 50 h of the reaction, and after a long time, the current gradually decreased to the level without loading the electrocatalyst (Supplementary Fig. 12). This shows that the surface modiﬁcation of the electrocatalyst cannot resist the corrosion of Cl− in seawater. Metal hydroxide itself will also be reconstructed in the OER reaction, which will also be accompanied by the problems of Cl− coordination and structural collapse. Finally, the structure is destroyed and gradually dissolved and peeled off. This extra loaded electrocatalyst protective layer often protects the photoanode by its own corrosion and consumption, which cannot fundamentally solve the long-term stability problem. In summary, we revealed that excessive hydration reconstruction of the surface will corrode the surface of the oxide photoanode with the corrosion of Cl− ions in the solution. The anchoring of the surface lattice by Sn hinders the transfer of protons to lattice oxygen, and the probability of oxygen hydrogen bonding will decrease due to the strong M–O bond, thereby suppressing the surface reconstruction and coordination of Cl−. The Sn/β-Fe2O3 photoanode constitutes by far the most durable photoanode for seawater splitting. This strategy can also improve the durability of other photoanodes, such as α-Fe2O3 (Supplementary Fig. 13). This study will pave a new path to solving the problem of the long-term durability of photoelectrodes in energy conversion.",

In this paper, the mechanical behaviour of polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanocomposites with graphene grafted with polymeric chains under tensile and compression is investigated using molecular dynamics. The influence of the functional groups (-NH2 and –OH) that bond the polymer chain to graphene is analysed. It is found that the system containing the –NH2 functional group showed lower mechanical properties than the system containing the –OH functional group. The mechanical properties of five PEG-nanocomposites are investigated: PEG/G, PEG/GNH-1PEG-S, PEG/GNH-2PEG-L, PEG/GNH-1PEG-S-NH2, PEG/GO-1PEG-S. The radius distribution function values and the variation of interfacial interaction energy are also examined. It is shown that functionalization of the graphene sheet increases the magnitude of the interaction energy, and it also reveals higher adhesion between graphene surface and PEG matrix. It is found that the mechanical properties of PEG are mostly improved in the longitudinal direction (reinforcement up to 43 %). Despite the high interaction between the nanofiller and PEG matrix, the low intrinsic properties of the nanofiller, namely Young's modulus, as well as the rupture of the graphene sheet during the deformation process deteriorated the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite.

One involves the encapsulation of the hydrophobic PtCx1 within an amphiphilic comb polymer (MNC@poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) [PMAO]–PtCx1), whereas the other involves the direct binding of the hydrophilic PtCx2 to the surface of the MNC mediated by a ligand-exchange procedure (MNC@OH–PtCx2).

PLIM measurements on agarose phantoms demonstrate significantly longer excited-state lifetimes compared to the short-lived autofluorescence of biological background. Additionally, both nanosystems perform as effective MRI contrast agents (CAs): the r2* values are 3–4 times higher than for the commercial CA ferucarbotran. MNC@PMAO–PtCx1 particles also cause significant increases in r2. While the ligand exchange procedure efficiently anchors PtCxs to the MNC surface, the polymeric encapsulation ensures higher colloidal stability, contributing to differences in PLIM and MRI outcomes.

Towards this, nano-indentation tests are carried out in both the MLS specimens. The maximum shear stress (τmax) is found to be higher (∼7.2 GPa) in the undeformed specimen in comparison to the deformed one (∼4.2 GPa). Further, the activation volume (Ωv) in the deformed specimen is observed to be towards the higher side as compared to the undeformed specimen. The distinct variation in τmax and Ωv in both specimens strongly suggests that the different dislocation activities could occur during the onset of plasticity of the MLS specimens. The dislocation nucleation mechanism in the undeformed specimen is governed by the nucleation of fresh dislocations under the indenter tip. However, the dislocation nucleation in deformed specimen is predominantly attributed to the multiplication of pre-existing dislocations. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been employed to comprehend the possible dislocation mechanism underneath the indenter tip and validate the experimental results. The P-h curve obtained from MD simulation reveals that the load requirement for the onset of the plasticity (i.e., first pop-in) in the undeformed specimen is higher than that in the deformed specimen, which agrees well with the experimental results.

No obvious Si 2p XPS signal was found, indicating that SiO 2 templates have been completely removed (Supplementary Fig. 6b). The high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum with two relatively weak peaks centered at 711.1 eV (Fe 2p3/2) and 723.9 eV (Fe 2p1/2) suggests the positive oxidation states of Fe species in the Fe SAC (Supplementary Fig. 6c) 50 . This is consistent with our XAS analysis (Fig. 2b). The Fe K-edge Xray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) of Fe SAC presents a near-edge absorption energy between Fe metal foil and Fe2 O 3 references, indicating that the oxidation state of Fe single atoms sits between Fe 0 and Fe3+ (Fig. 2b). The corresponding Fouriertransformed (FT) k3 -weighted extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) spectrum shows one dominant peak at around 1.6 Å, which can be assigned to the Fe–N coordination at the ﬁrst shell (Fig. 2c) 49–51 . No Fe–Fe interaction peak at 2.2 Å can be observed, excluding the possibility of any Fe clusters or nanoparticles in our catalyst. These results conclude that the Fe atoms are atomically dispersed in the N-doped carbon (NC) matrix, consistent with our STEM observations. Owing to the powerful resolutions in both k and R spaces, wavelet transform (WT) of Fe K-edge EXAFS oscillations was employed to further explore the atomic dispersion of Fe in Fe SAC. Only one intensity maximum is observed at ~4.6 Å−1 in the WT contour plots, which corresponds to the Fe–N coordination. No intensity maximum belonging to Fe–Fe contribution can be observed, compared with the WT plots of Fe foil and Fe 2O 3 (Fig. 2d). To better understand the Fe coordination environment, we also conducted the EXAFS ﬁtting to obtain the structural parameters and extract the quantitative chemical conﬁguration of Fe atoms (Fig. 2e, f). Each Fe atom is coordinated by about 4N atoms in average, and the mean bond length is 1.92 Å (Supplementary Table 2). According to these ﬁtting results, the proposed coordination structure of Fe SAC is Fe–N4 , which is shown as the inset in Fig. 2f. The EXAFS ﬁtting results of Fe foil and Fe 2 O3 are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 2. Additionally, only one peak at the L3 -edge and no clear multiple structures are found in the Fe L-edge XANES spectrum of Fe SAC, which suggests a unique feature of delocalized Fe 3d electrons of Fe SAC49 .

The experiments are conducted on the testing set which includes 90 underwater images and the challenging set including 60 underwater images. We show several results in Figs. 13 and 14. In Fig. 13, the proposed Water-Net effectively removes the haze on the underwater images and remits color casts, while the competing methods introduce unexpected colors (e.g., fusion-based [31], GDCP [40], histogram prior [45], Water CycleGAN [53], and Dense GAN [55]) and artifacts (e.g., fusion-based [31], retinex-based [33], histogram prior [45], Water CycleGAN [53], and Dense GAN [55]) or have little effect on inputs (e.g., blurriness-based [46]). In addition, it is interesting that our results even achieve better visual quality than the corresponding reference images (e.g., more natural appearance and better details). This is because that the perceptual loss optimized Water-Net can learn the potential attributes of good visual quality from the large-scale real-world underwater image dataset. For the results on challenging set shown in Fig. 14, the proposed Water-Net produces visually pleasing results. By contrast, other methods tend to introduce artifacts, over-enhancement (e.g., foregrounds), and color casts (e.g., reddish or greenish color).

IV. Our Water-Net achieves the best performance in terms of full-reference image quality assessment. In addition, instead of pairwise comparison, we conduct a user study to score the visual quality of the results on challenging set. This is because some images in the challenging set are too difﬁcult to obtain satisfactory results following the procedure of reference image generation. Thus, we invited 50 participants (the same volunteers with the reference image generation) to score results. The scores have ﬁve scales ranging from 5 to 1 which represent “Excellent”, “Good”, “Fair”, “Poor” and “Bad”, respectively. The average scores of the results by each method on challenging set are shown in Table VI. Besides, we also provide the standard deviation of the results by each method on challenging set. We exclude the scores of Water CycleGAN [53] and Dense GAN [55] due to their obviously unpleasing results as shown in Fig. 14. Our Water-Net receives the highest average score and lowest standard deviation, which indicates our method produces better results from a subjective perspective and has more robust performance.

A few examples such as fullerenol23 and poly(methyl methacrylate)-supported polydiacetylene lms24 are the exceptions, which can detect both ionic and nonionic types of surfactants. However, both these methods are not simple to implement because they require expensive and diﬃcult preparation methodologies. To solve these issues, we developed rhodamine B (RhB)-anchored reduced graphene oxide (RBGO), which responded to all types of surfactants and oﬀered a facile method for the determination of surfactants in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Furthermore, RBGO exhibited selectivity toward SDS by the introduction of CuSO4 , which selectively quenched SDS. RBGO was prepared according to our previously reported procedure,25 in which RBGO was utilized for the selective sensing of cucurbit[7]uril. Graphene oxide and various other carbon nanomaterials have been explored as the sensors of biomarkers and biologically important analytes.26 Similarly, surfactants have been known to bind with graphene oxide (GO) and thus, we envisaged that surfactants may competitively bind with GO, thereby causing the compensative release of RhB quantitatively from RBGO. When we utilized RBGO with surfactants, it released RhB to balance the binding quantity of the surfactants. Surprisingly, RGBO responded to both ionic and non-ionic surfactants and to the best of our knowledge, no such simple detection method exists except those employing fullerenol and poly(methyl methacrylate)-supported polydiacetylene lms for sensing all types of surfactants. Furthermore, supramolecularly assembled nanomaterials have not been utilized for the determination of surfactants until now. Based on this, here, we reported the quantitative and qualitative determination of ionic and nonionic surfactants using RGBO. We believe that the present method may complement other sensors of surfactants, and it may oﬀer a very simple protocol to measure the quantity of surfactants in water and other relevant samples (Scheme 1).",

It is a challenge to improve the flame retardancy of PMMA while maintaining its inherent mechanical properties. In this study, a polyphosphate-coated silica (SZP) was prepared, which was compounded with dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). At the same time, methacrylamide (MAM), which can be copolymerized with PMMA, was introduced to construct a synergistic phosphorus-nitrogen-silicon flame retardant system. The three components can work together in the gas phase and condensed phase. The results showed that when 12.5% DMMP, 5% MAM and 2.5% SZP were added, the composite material had the best comprehensive performance, its limiting oxygen index (LOI) reached 25.1%, and its total heat release was only 70% of the pure sample. More importantly, the addition of DMMP would significantly reduce the mechanical properties of PMMA. The introduction of SZP and MAM alleviated this problem. Compared with the pure sample, the mechanical properties of PMMA7 did not decrease but increased slightly. The flame retardant mechanism was also analyzed.

In this work, thermodynamic simulation based on a modified two-temperature model and plasmonic effects was developed to demonstrate the local energy evolution during plasmonic nanowelding. Incident laser energy was highly confined within the junction area of two nanoparticles, which was beneficial for localized and controlled nanoparticles sintering. Upon nanojoint formation, spatially limited heating induced by plasmonic effects resulted in partial melting along the interface region, which could be further enhanced by subsequent heat accumulation under multiple laser pulses irradiation. Due to the resultant large temperature gradient and rapid heating–cooling process (up to 4.4 × 1010 K/s), the amorphous interface region can be observed at the junction. Driven by the large-surface tension and fast atomic diffusion at the sintering neck, two nanoparticles tended to merge to form a large dimer. This plasmonic effect-induced nano confined energy will be reformulated with the changing morphologies. Nanowelding of two metal nanoparticles was stopped at a certain stage due to limited energy input. Optical and electrical performance of nanowelded metal nanoparticles can therefore be designed via this controlled nanowelding process. This ultrafast laser-induced plasmonic nanowelding shows great potential in precise construction of small-scale structures with a controlled formation process, which can be used for the fabrication of printable nanocircuits.",

PCR: PCR has been widely used in molecular biology research due to its non-expensive, easy-to-use, and reliable results for replicating the targeted DNA segment. It is often regarded as a qualitative technique used to detect the absence or presence of targeted DNA. However, the real-time PCR is an advanced version that also tells how much of a speciﬁc DNA or gene is present in the environment. For example, it has been used for detecting and quantifying the critical physiological groups of bacteria in environmental samples such as ammonia oxidizers, methane oxidizers, and sulfate reducers by targeting amoA, pmoA, and dsrA genes, respectively (Foti et al. 2007). Another advancement was observed in i.e., LH-PCR for detecting amplicon length variations, but mutation in the genes can produce different results (Rastogi & Sani 2011). One of the signiﬁcant limitations of LH-PCR was the incapability to low resolution for complex amplicon peaks, leading to underestimation of diversity, which may occur due to similarity in the amplicon length of distinct taxa. Other errors can also arise due to the nonspeciﬁc binding of the primers and the requirement of prior sequence information. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization: FISH is an easy and straightforward molecular cytogenetic technique requiring ﬂuorescent probes that only bind with the sequence with a high degree of sequence complementarity. This technique has been useful for high-resolution automated analysis of mixed microbial populations when combined with ﬂow cytometry (Rastogi & Sani 2011). However, low signal intensity, background ﬂuorescence, and target inaccessibility are the major problems encountered in the FISH analysis.",

It is not known whether similar changes occur in vivo. Unlike Th17 cells, gdT cells produce IL-17 by non-classical major histocompatibility and have properties of both innate immunity similar to NK cells and acquired immunity – variable gdTCR (13). Whether gd T cells exhibit protumor characteristics similar to Treg cells or IFN g mediated antitumor characteristics depends on the properties of the environment in which they are found. There is evidence that the production of IL17 in gd T cells takes place independently of TCR activation, while the secretion of IFN g is enhanced after antigen exposure, so there are two phenotypes of gd T cells: “innate” IL-17 gd T and “acquired” IFN g+ gd T (14). An elevated concentration of IL-17 was found in many tumors and was mostly associated with a worse prognosis (15). Zhu and colleagues were among the ﬁrst to describe the expression of IL-17 in breast tumor tissue proposing a role of IL-17 in breast cancer invasion. Somewhat surprising, they found that macrophages were the main cells secreting IL-17, identiﬁed by cytology and CD68 staining (16). IL-17 directly induced breast cancer cell invasion independently of TNFa, which was inhibited by MMP selective antagonists. A few years later, analyzing the TME, Su and colleagues demonstrated that tumor cells form breast cancer cell lines and tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts produce a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine milieu and secrete RANTES and MCP-1 that recruit Th17 cells in the TME (17). In 2013 Cochaud and colleagues analyzed the role of IL-17A and IL-17A producing TILs in human breast cancers. They found moderate to strong inﬁltration of IL-17-producing lymphocytes and macrophages in 20% of breast cancer samples, with a trend of association with estrogen receptor negative tumors (ER-), not reaching statistical signiﬁcance, probably due to small numbers. Moreover, they showed that breast cancer cells harbor IL17 receptors, and upon stimulation with IL-17 respond with the activation of ERK1/2 protein kinase pathway leading to cell proliferation and taxane resistance (18). Findings from several other studies supported the role of IL-17 in breast cancer progression and treatment resistance (19–24). Apart from having a direct effect on the breast cancer cell leading to the activation of ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways through phosphorylation of tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2) (25), it seems that IL-17 can exert its protumor effect in various different ways. IL-17 can promote tumor angiogenesis by inducing angiogenic factors CXCL8, MMP2, MMP-9, and VEGF (26), it can direct the TME towards an immunosuppressive one by inhibiting apoptosis through NF-kB pathway activation (27) and by inducing the polarization of neutrophils towards a CD8+ T cell-suppressive phenotype (28). IL-17 can also induce the production of IL-6 and CCL20 in metastatic, but not in non-metastatic breast cancer tumor cells (23), thereby promoting inﬂammation and proliferation through IL-6 mediated STAT3 pathway activation (27). Even though metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer tumor cells display different responses to IL17 in vitro, it does not mean IL-17 exerts no effect on non-metastatic cells in vivo.

Figure 5a shows accumulated voltage reversal time series of cell voltage during fuel starvation tests. For a clear presentation, the ﬁrst two times of reversal tests are shown in the inset. The as-prepared MEA-2 shows an unexpected repetitive reversal tolerant performance with VRTs of 66, 194, 1614, and 4693 min for the four reversal tests individually. This discovery shows almost the best repetitive reversal performance and the longest accumulated VRT until now. Subsequently, the reversal tolerant declines signiﬁcantly as the fuel starvation tests are repeated in the previous studies. The reasons for high-reversal tolerant performance will be explained in detail later. Moreover, the high voltage (approximately 0.7 V)6 at the cathode can cause carbon corrosion and lead to performance degradation. As described above, shown in Figure 5b,c, after the ﬁrst reversal test, the cell voltage degradation and degradation rate at 1.0 A cm−2 are only 24 mV and 3.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the cell performance rapidly decreases after the second fuel starvation test, which can be attributed to the carbon corrosion (both at the anode and cathode) and the increase of Ohmic resistance during the long VRTs.

SEM and AFM spectra demonstrate that the generation of agglomeration phenomena after Fe doping provides the nucleation point for the phase transition, and the difference in the Gibbs free energies of the two phases provides the driving force for the phase transition. XPS measurements verify that the formation of oxides after Fe doping contributes to the surface thermodynamic equilibrium and the possibility of the surface atomic rearrangements during the anatase to rutile phase transition. The energy band diagram illustrates at the level of electronic structure that the phase transition raises the position of the conduction band minimum of the film and the oxide of Fe that is formed becomes the charge complex center. Finally, the results of degradation of methylene blue solution under simulated visible light irradiation show that Fe doping reduces the photocatalytic ability of TiO2 films.

To the best of our knowledge, this represents the ﬁrst work that has validated the use of a single network architecture across multiple BCI datasets, each with their own feature characteristics and data set sizes. Our work introduced the use of Depthwise and Separable Convolutions [42] for EEG signal classiﬁcation, and showed that they can be used to construct an EEG-speciﬁc model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts. Finally, through the use of feature visualization and ablation analysis, we show that neurophysiologically interpretable features can be extracted from the EEGNet model, providing further validation and evidence that the network performance is not being driven by noise or artifact signals in the data. This last ﬁnding is particularly important, as it is a critical component to understanding the validity and robustness of CNN model architectures not just for EEG [32,101], but for CNN architectures in general [16,94,99]. The learning capacity of CNNs comes in part from their ability to automatically extract intricate feature representations from raw data",

Herein, strategic Li+ co-doping was employed to boost the NIR emission of BaGe4O9:Cr3+. In the phosphor, Li+ ions play a pivotal role in the distribution of Cr3+ on the two octahedral sites and the elimination of Cr4+ and crystal defects, leading to a 42.9-fold enhancement of Cr3+ emission. The obtained BaGe4O9:Cr3+,Li+ exhibited broadband emission centered at 808 nm, with an FWHM of 177 nm and an internal quantum efficiency of 61.3%. A fabricated pc-LED device utilizing the phosphor showcased an NIR radiant flux of 24.8 mW and a photoelectric efficiency of 8.9% at 100 mA.

The PGGT-Fe3+ hydrogel is composed of dual networks of polyacrylamide and gelatin for organic cross-linking, using water/glycerol as the dispersion medium, and incorporates a viscous substance: tannic acid, and a conductive substance: metal ions (Fe3+). Due to the introduction of the abundant amino, carboxylic acid, and hydroxyl functional groups on gelatin and tannic acid, the PGGT-Fe3+ hydrogel exhibits excellent and repeatable adhesion capabilities on various surfaces (including glass, metal, plastic, and pigskin) with maximum adhesion strength of 98 kPa when attached to pigskin. Furthermore, based on the stable conductive network and high conductivity, the hydrogel not only exhibits strain sensitivity, fast response, and stability but also can stably collect epidermal bio signals.

You should use a walkthrough like https://forgottenwars.com/bg1/ar2600.htm to help you give me quests. \n\nStart me as the protagonist from the start of the story in the Prologue before leaving Candlekeep and after Gorion says to the protagonist to get ready to leave. In this prologue describe in a mysterious way without spoiling the plot my history Gorion's apprentice/ward descriptively in at least 2 paragraphs with things I may have done including my childhood growing up Candlekeep the famous library-fortress, including made up elements based on my chosen race and mentioning some training my class may have had but keep in context of the Baldur’s Gate story. During the story ask me questions with 2 choices on what I would do next and you should attempt to make me reach the end of the plot using my decisions.\n\nMake sure to follow these rules during the story:\n\n1. Always describe each separate location I arrive in with lots of details only once, examples like: A city or forest's physical appearance, cultural atmosphere (including local customs, traditions, beliefs), historical background, economic status, political environment, demographic makeup, and social scene. A room or building's: physical appearance (including furniture, decor, lighting, etc.), its function and use, and any sensory details (such as smells, sounds, or textures) to create a vivid atmosphere.\n\n2. Write like Edward Packard language/writing style but for adults using vivid descriptions and imaginative storytelling and NPC's can have short conversations with me before continuing the CYOA.\n\n3. Always make sure there is a question at the end of any of your answers to allow me to continue.\n\n4. I (the protagonist) is never given a choice that leads to death, do not spoil the plot before the end and do not have dead-end paths that lead to the story's abrupt end.\n\n5. Include as many main story battles as the story has and have a romance running with Aerie after I meet her - ending with a romantic scene after the end of the story.\n\n6. Show (optional) for any answer option that would lead to a side-quest.\n\n7. Show (main) for any answer option that would continue the main story only if it is with a side-quest answer (optional).\n\n8. Before starting the adventure you must describe in a mysterious way without spoiling the plot my history Gorion's apprentice/ward descriptively in at least 2 paragraphs with things I may have done including my childhood growing up Candlekeep the famous library-fortress, including made up elements based on my chosen race and mentioning some training my class may have had but keep in context of the Baldur’s Gate story.\n\n9. You must include some story quests in plot order like these: Baldur's Gate 1: The Unseeing Eye: Finding the Lost Sorcerer, The Gnoll Stronghold: Clearing the Gnoll Camp, The Price of Neutrality: Rescuing the Duke's Daughter, The Iron Throne: Infiltrating the Thief's Guild, The Necromancer's Dungeon: Rescuing Imoen. Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn: The Main Quest, The Child of Bhaal: The Ascension of the God-Child, The Underdark: The Journey Below, The Planar Sphere: Exploring the Dimension, The Imprisonment of Jon Irenicus: Rescuing the Mage, The Slaver's Stockade: Rescuing the Slaves.\n10. When I decide to leave Candlekeep in the story, Gorion must be killed and die fighting like he does in Baldur's Gate 1 against a ‘tall armoured figure’ and his gang in the Lion’s Way area. Describe the scene and battle in detail and that I flee but stay in the Lion’s Way area and Imoen appears as she does in the game.\n\n11. I must meet these NPCs in plot order to decide whether to join or not: Baldur's Gate 1 Companions: Imoen, Jaheira, Khalid, Minsc, Dynaheir, Xzar, Montaron. Baldur's Gate 2 Companions: Jan Jansen, Haer'Dalis, Anomen, Viconia, Branwen, Nalia, Aerie, Korgan, Valygar, Yoshimo.\n\n12. In fight or battle scenes you must use my class skills when describing how I fight. Do the same for NPCs also. Make all battles have unusual weapons and special powers. Give me choices about how to proceed in the battle, allowing me to make decisions that affect the outcome. I can choose how to land the killing blow at the end of battles.\n\n13. My abilities must get stronger as the story progresses by leveling up progressively, like after a battle. Each time I level up you must indicate it by describing me feeling emotions of change, growth or obtaining power and add show (lvl up) and add 1 level to my level permanently. In fights or battles, make sure I use new powers or abilities or variety.\n\n14. At the top of every message you write during the story write simply the name chapter of the game with the area/city I am in and who is travelling with me currently if anyone. Also write just my name and class level simply. Example: Chapter 1: Candlekeep Inn - David, Elf Fighter Lvl 99, Alone\n\n15. Never write dialogue text for the protagonist unless it is from an answer I choose.\n\nIf you understand the task then before starting the task, ask me 'Welcome to the Baldur's Gate story, what is your name, race, and class?' Do not start the task/story until I tell you my name/race/class and make those the name, race & class of the protagonist (me)."

As Gorion's apprentice and ward, you have lived a life surrounded by ancient tomes and dusty scrolls, the musky scent of parchment permeating the air. Despite the quiet, scholarly atmosphere, the fortress hums with the energy of seekers of knowledge and the whispers of secrets hidden within its texts.\n\nAs a Monk of the Open Hand, your early years were spent learning the intricacies of martial arts and the delicate balance of body, mind, and spirit. The monks at Candlekeep provided you with discipline and training, shaping you into a formidable warrior. Your half-elf heritage allowed you to connect with both humans and elves within the fortress, and you gained a unique understanding of their customs and beliefs. Growing up in Candlekeep, you've had the opportunity to learn many languages and explore the depths of history, weaving your heritage into the fabric of your existence.\n\nOne day, Gorion, your mentor and guardian, tells you to gather your belongings and prepare to leave Candlekeep. There is an urgency in his voice that you've never heard before, and his eyes seem to hold a secret that he is not yet willing to share. You understand that something significant is about to unfold, but you have no idea what it might be.\n\nAs you prepare to depart, you are faced with a choice:\n\n1. Will you spend a few moments saying farewell to your friends and mentors in Candlekeep, knowing that you may never return? (optional)\n2.

The architecture is a mix of intricate stone carvings and sturdy wooden beams, supporting the weight of centuries of knowledge.\n\nFirst, you visit the monks who trained you in the ways of the Open Hand. They share words of wisdom and encouragement, reminding you to remain balanced and focused in the face of uncertainty. Their eyes are filled with a mixture of sadness and pride as they bid you farewell.\n\nNext, you stop by the scriptorium, where many scholars spend their days transcribing ancient texts. The room is filled with the sound of quills scratching against parchment and the scent of ink and vellum. Your friends among the scribes wish you luck on your journey and ask you to remember the importance of knowledge in your future endeavors.\n\nWith your farewells said, you return to Gorion, who seems both relieved and worried by your decision to visit your friends. He urges you to make haste, as the need to leave grows more urgent by the minute. With a heavy heart, you follow Gorion out of Candlekeep and into the unknown.\n\nAs you leave Candlekeep, Gorion says you must make a choice:\n\n1. Will you take the coastal road, which offers a scenic view of the cliffs and the sea but may be longer? (optional)\n2.

The journal details their encounters with various creatures and bandits, as well as their search for ancient artifacts and hidden treasure. The last entry speaks of their intention to seek refuge in a nearby cave for the night.\n\nArmed with this new information, Gorion seems slightly relieved, but the urgency in his eyes has not diminished.

Therefore, the neutral magnesium acceptor can be regarded as a solid-state analog of the helium atom. By compensation with donors one can study its singly ionized state which is the analog of singly ionized helium. It is interesting to note, however, that magnesium, following a similar diffusion procedure, is an interstitial double donor in silicon.' The factors leading to this difference have yet to be established. In conclusion, magnesium can be diffused into germaium resulting in substitutional acceptors.

In human cancers, tumor progression is associated with increased expression (typically via amplification of the remaining allele), which implies contrasting roles of CUX1 in tumor establishment versus progression8 . This dosage sensitivity is also seen outside of the cancer context: specific levels of CUX1 are required for the fate specification of numerous cell types, as its target genes encompass a wide range of cellular functions 7 . To explain such a dose sensitivity of CUX1 on expression of its target genes, an analog model has been proposed: long-distance, low-affinity CUX1 binding sites loop to the gene promoters, incorporating input from other genomic features to finetune the transcriptional response 7 . This same finetuning mechanism may apply to this functional SNP; consistent with this notion, Jiang et al. 5 show that CUX1 has a higher affinity to the risk allele than to the non-risk allele. Indeed, in the context of arterial endothelial cells, this functional SNP coincides with active enhancer marks, probably coregulating CDKN2A and other components of the CDKN2A/B locus, such as p14ARF, CDKN2B and CDKN2B-AS1 (also known as ANRIL), through a long-range interaction. Regulation of CDKN2A expression by local 3D chromatin architecture is consistent with the well-established role of Polycomb repressor complexes in establishing an inhibitory landscape that needs to be removed to allow p16 expression during entry into senescence 4 . Atherosclerosis involves senescence in different cell types, including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and other stromal cells1 . In the Jiang et al.5 study, in addition to endothelial cells, the CUX1dependent induction of CDKN2A and other transcripts in this locus is confirmed in human vascular smooth muscle cells. Increased expression of both CUX1 and p16 in plaque regions are also noted in human carotid artery. Further, phenotypical consequences of the CUX1–p16 axis were tested in primary human endothelial cells. Jiang et al.5 show that CUX1 is upregulated during endothelial cell senescence and ectopic CUX1 induces senescence via p16 induction and the DDR. Interestingly, CUX1-induced DDR is p16-dependent. Although the association between senescence and a persistent DDR is welldocumented 9 , p16 alone is known to induce senescence without a prominent DDR 10 . In addition, the positive relationship between CUX1 and DDR appears contradictory to its more commonly described DNA damage repair role. Genetic inactivation of CUX1 was found to delay the repair of oxidative DNA damage 8 , as CUX1 functions as an accessory factor that becomes rapidly recruited to sites of DNA damage, directly stimulating 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) (which is involved in base excision repair) 8 . The anti-senescence activity of CUX1 has consistently been suggested: Cux1-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts are highly sensitive to oxidative stress and ectopic CUX1 prevents oncogenic RAS-induced senescence in human diploid fibroblasts 11,12 . One possible way to reconcile these apparent discrepancies may be a model in which cellular effects downstream of CUX1 activation are determined in a cooperative manner, rather than a linear model with a single outcome (Fig. 1b). This is possible owing to the diversity of its transcriptional targets. A recently reported example13 , discussed by Jiang et al.5 , is the effect that p16 upregulation has on nucleotide metabolism. A proposed mechanism for mediating the bypassing of senescence following p16 knockdown is through activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which in turn increases nucleotide synthesis13 . As depleted nucleotide pools are a source of DNA damage, it is therefore conceivable that upregulation of p16 by CUX1 is also sufficient to reverse this process, instead resulting in increased DNA damage. However, it remains unclear whether p16 alone is sufficient for this cellular effect. Interestingly, another CUX1 transcriptional target is PIK3IP1; this gene encodes an inhibitor of the PI3K–AKT signaling pathway, which is also directly feeds into mTORC1 activation 14 . This further reinforces the notion that various parallel pathways can converge on the same terminal effector and contribute to ultimate cellular phenotype, possibly in a cellular context-dependent manner. Another possible source of diverging phenotypes downstream of CUX1 activation lies in the nature of its DNA binding capacities. Although all of the examples described in the preceding paragraph involve the transcriptional targets of CUX1, this protein is also known to have functional roles that are transcriptionindependent. The most prominent of these is the aforementioned role in DNA damage repair. The localization of CUX1 to sites of DNA damage, promoting assembly and activation of proteins that make up the repair machinery, occurs independently of the consensus CUX1 binding motif. From a common upstream signal (such as oxidative or other genotoxic stress), CUX1 is upregulated and can bind to either its consensus motifs in the regulatory elements or to random sites of DNA damage on the genome. The latter has a reasonably straightforward effect of recruiting DNA repair machinery to repair the damage, whereas the former can have further wide-ranging effects downstream of the transcriptional target itself — and these effects can induce DNA damage. The optimal combination between these modes of CUX1 functionality, in addition to the relative contribution of its diverse transcriptional targets, may determine the resulting cellular phenotype. This post-GWAS study 5 provides an encouraging example of addressing the challenging task of transforming information into knowledge. This was achieved through a sequential approach, recently developed by the authors 6 , consisting of unbiased screening for functionally relevant risk alleles from a pool of known SNPs and using those risk alleles to pull down their preferential binding factors (Fig. 1a). The study uncovers a finetuning mechanism of how transcription in the CDKN2A/B locus is controlled in relevant cell types in atherosclerosis, although the actual involvement of CUX1 and its downstream signaling in vascular disorders needs to be validated in in vivo contexts. Further, the functional relevance of the risk allele in this functional SNP and the CUX1–p16 pathway in other diseases (in particular, in cancer) will be interesting to explore",

Use JavaScript to populate the speaker timeline rows and bars based on data.\n```javascript\n// script.js\nconst speakers = [\n  {\n    name: 'Speaker 1',\n    times: [\n      { start: 0, end: 30 },\n      { start: 60, end: 90 },\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Speaker 2',\n    times: [\n      { start: 30, end: 60 },\n      { start: 90, end: 120 },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n\nconst video = document.querySelector('.video');\nconst timeline = document.querySelector('.timeline');\n\nvideo.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', () => {\n  const videoDuration = video.duration;\n  createTimeline(speakers, videoDuration);\n});\n\nfunction createTimeline(speakers, videoDuration) {\n  speakers.forEach((speaker) => {\n    const timelineRow = document.createElement('div');\n    timelineRow.className = 'timeline-row';\n\n    speaker.times.forEach((time) => {\n      const timelineBar = document.createElement('div');\n      timelineBar.className = 'timeline-bar';\n      timelineBar.style.left = `${(time.start / videoDuration) * 100}%`;\n      timelineBar.style.width = `${((time.end - time.start) / videoDuration) * 100}%`;\n      timelineRow.appendChild(timelineBar);\n    });\n\n    timeline.appendChild(timelineRow);\n  });\n}\n```\nReplace the `your-video-file.mp4` with your video file's URL, and update the `speakers` array in the JavaScript file with the appropriate data for your conference call.\n\nThis code will create a new section with a video and speaker timeline below it. The timeline will always have the same width as the video, and it will display colored bars to represent when each speaker was actively speaking."

Early evidence suggests that removal of senescent cells using senolytic drugs improves the aging phenotype in mice and may improve the health of individuals with chronic diseases. Signs of skin aging, including wrinkles, and sagging, occur largely due to the accumulation of senescent fibroblasts within the dermis; However, there is currently no skin treatment that eliminates senescent cells. In this study, human fibroblasts subjected to replicative aging and ionizing radiation exposure are used to screen plant extracts for potential senescent cell-destructive and/or senescent cell-forming activities. Angelica acutiloba—a traditional Chinese herbal medicine—selectively kills senescent cells without affecting the proliferating cells. Among the major components of this herb, ligustilide shows promising senescent cell-destructive properties, and selectively eliminates senescent cells by inducing an apoptosis. Moreover, ligustilide markedly inhibits senescence-associated secretory phenotypes. Administration of ligustilide to mouse skin eliminates senescent cells and increases dermal collagen density and subcutaneous adipose tissue content; it selectively promotes death of senescent cells without affecting non-senescent cells. These results provide evidence that a natural compound—ligustilide—may exhibit therapeutic effects on the skin aging phenotype by specifically inducing apoptosis in senescent cells.",

However, a safe and low-toxicity synthesis method for fluorides and the design of a compatible electrolyte formula are still challenging. Here, we propose a dual strategy of mild C–F scissoring fluorination and a local high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to enable highly reversible Li–Fe–F conversion batteries. A facile and safe scissoring strategy at a low temperature (95 °C) enables the preparation of a carbon–iron fluoride composite with a porous cubic cage-like structure. CFx plays a double role as a solid fluorination agent and an in situ conductive network after defluorination. The as-prepared fluoride cathode delivers a reversible capacity as high as 300 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles. The further LHCE strategy not only enhances the oxidation stable voltage of the electrolyte (&gt;5 V) and the transference number of Li+ (0.74), but also realizes dual protection of the fluoride cathode and Li metal anode by facilitating the construction of robust cathode– and anode–electrolyte interfaces, respectively. The LHCE-assisted fluoride battery releases a higher reversible capacity of 335 mA h g−1 after 130 cycles. This work provides a solution to high-performance carbon–fluoride conversion cathodes by a synergetic effect of tailored synthesis, electroactive particle texture and electrolyte formula.",

The input unipolar PAM4 signal with equal amplitude distance (UPAM4-A) is coupled with two input pump lights and injected into the symmetric interferometric fiber optic parameter amplifier (FOPA) to achieve the separation of the UPAM4-A and the new pump light generated at the signal frequency based on the non-degenerate PSA.

The error vector magnitude (EVM) and bit error ratio (BER) performance of the system are measured before and after AOFC with different input and receiver optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR). For the input UPAM4-A signal with an input OSNR of 27 dB, there is about 8.2 dB BER performance improvement in receiver OSNR for the final converted QPSK signal.

These enzymes are finding considerable use in industrial biofuel production. Crystal structures of polysaccharide monooxygenases have emerged, but experimental studies are yet to determine the solution structure of the Cu site and how this relates to reactivity. From X-ray absorption near edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies, we observed a change from four-coordinate Cu(II) to three-coordinate Cu(I) of the active site in solution, where three protein-derived nitrogen ligands coordinate the Cu in both redox states, and a labile hydroxide ligand is lost upon reduction. The spectroscopic data allowed for density functional theory calculations of an enzyme active site model, where the optimized Cu(I) and (II) structures were consistent with the experimental data. The O2 reactivity of the Cu(I) site was probed by EPR and stopped-flow absorption spectroscopies, and a rapid one-electron reduction of O2 and regeneration of the resting Cu(II) enzyme were observed. This reactivity was evaluated computationally, and by calibration to Cu-superoxide model complexes, formation of an end-on Cu-AA9-superoxide species was found to be thermodynamically favored. We discuss how this thermodynamically difficult one-electron reduction of O2 is enabled by the unique protein structure where two nitrogen ligands from His1 dictate formation of a T-shaped Cu(I) site, which provides an open coordination position for strong O2 binding with very little reorganization energy.",

Here, an in situ growth strategy to achieve high dispersion of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)-anchored cellulose nanofibrils to enhance the interface connection quality is proposed. Followed by a facile freeze-casting and carbonization treatment, sustainable biomimetic porous carbon aerogels with highly dispersed and closely connected MOF-derived magnetic nano-capsules are fabricated. Thanks to the tight interface bonding of nano-capsule microstructure, these aerogels showcase remarkable mechanical robustness and flexibility, tunable electrical conductivity and magnetization intensity, and excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance. Achieving a reflection loss of −70.8 dB and a broadened effective absorption bandwidth of 6.0 GHz at a filling fraction of merely 2.2 wt.%, leading to a specific reflection loss of −1450 dB mm−1, surpassing all carbon-based aerogel absorbers so far reported. Meanwhile, the aerogel manifests high magnetic sensing sensibility and excellent thermal insulation. This work provides an extendable in situ growth strategy for synthesizing MOF-modified cellulose nanofibril structures, thereby promoting the development of high-value-added multifunctional magnetic carbon aerogels for applications in electromagnetic compatibility and protection, thermal management, diversified sensing, Internet of Things devices, and aerospace.",

Créez un nouveau dossier pour votre extension, par exemple \"ChatExporter\".\n2. Créez un fichier `manifest.json` à l'intérieur du dossier. Ce fichier contient les informations de base sur l'extension et ses autorisations. Ajoutez le code suivant dans le fichier :\n```json\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 3,\n  \"name\": \"ChatExporter\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"Exportez les conversations au format MarkDown.\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"default_popup\": \"popup.html\",\n    \"default_icon\": {\n      \"16\": \"images/icon16.png\",\n      \"48\": \"images/icon48.png\",\n      \"128\": \"images/icon128.png\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"permissions\": [\"activeTab\"],\n  \"icons\": {\n    \"16\": \"images/icon16.png\",\n    \"48\": \"images/icon48.png\",\n    \"128\": \"images/icon128.png\"\n  }\n}\n```\n1. Créez un fichier `popup.html` dans le même dossier. Ce fichier est la structure HTML de votre popup. Ajoutez le code suivant :\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Chat Exporter</title>\n    <style>\n      body {\n        width: 300px;\n        height: 100px;\n        text-align: center;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h3>Exporter la conversation</h3>\n    <button id=\"exportButton\">Exporter au format MarkDown</button>\n    <script src=\"popup.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n1. Créez un fichier `popup.js` dans le même dossier. Ce fichier contiendra la logique pour récupérer la conversation et la convertir en MarkDown. Pour l'instant, ajoutez ce code pour détecter le clic sur le bouton :\n```javascript\ndocument.getElementById(\"exportButton\").addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  // Ici, nous récupérerons la conversation et la convertirons en MarkDown.\n});\n```\n1. Maintenant, nous devons ajouter du code pour récupérer la conversation de la page. Puisque la structure de la page n'a pas été fournie, je vais donner un exemple générique. Vous devrez adapter ce code pour correspondre à la structure de la page que vous ciblez.\n\nDans `popup.js`, ajoutez la fonction suivante :\n```javascript\nasync function fetchConversation() {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, (tabs) => {\n      chrome.tabs.executeScript(\n        tabs[0].id,\n        {\n          code: `\n            // Remplacez ce sélecteur CSS par celui qui correspond à la structure de la page ciblée.\n            const conversationElements = document.querySelectorAll('.conversation-element');\n            const conversationData = Array.from(conversationElements).map(element => ({\n              user: element.querySelector('.user').innerText,\n              message: element.querySelector('.message').innerText\n            }));\n            conversationData;\n          `,\n        },\n        (result) => {\n          resolve(result[0]);\n        }\n      );\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\n1. Ajoutez une fonction pour convertir la conversation récupérée en MarkDown :\n```javascript\nfunction conversationToMarkDown(conversation) {\n  return conversation\n    .map((\n```"
            },
            {

                "value": "élément) => {\nreturn `**${élément.user}**: ${élément.message}`;\n})\n.join(\"\\n\\n\");\n}\n```scss\n\n7. Modifiez l'écouteur d'événements du bouton pour récupérer la conversation, la convertir en MarkDown et l'exporter. Mettez à jour `popup.js` avec le code suivant :\n```javascript\ndocument.getElementById(\"exportButton\").addEventListener(\"click\", async () => {\n  const conversation = await fetchConversation();\n  const markdown = conversationToMarkDown(conversation);\n  exportToMarkDownFile(markdown, \"conversation.md\");\n});\n\nfunction exportToMarkDownFile(markdown, filename) {\n  const blob = new Blob([markdown], { type: \"text/markdown;charset=utf-8\" });\n  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n  const link = document.createElement(\"a\");\n  link.href = url;\n  link.download = filename;\n  link.click();\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    URL.revokeObjectURL(url);\n  }, 0);\n}\n\n```\n1. Enfin, créez un dossier `images` dans le dossier de l'extension et ajoutez des icônes aux tailles 16x16, 48x48 et 128x128. Nommez ces fichiers `icon16.png`, `icon48.png` et `icon128.png`, respectivement.\n\nMaintenant, vous avez une extension Chrome de base qui peut exporter la conversation en MarkDown. Pour tester l'extension :\n\n1. Ouvrez Chrome et allez sur `chrome://extensions`.\n2. Activez le mode développeur en haut à droite de la page.\n3. Cliquez sur \"Charger l'extension non empaquetée\" et sélectionnez le dossier de votre extension (`ChatExporter`).\n4. L'extension doit maintenant être visible dans la barre d'outils de Chrome.\n\nN'oubliez pas que vous devrez adapter le code pour qu'il corresponde à la structure de la page que vous ciblez. La fonction `fetchConversation` doit être mise à jour avec les sélecteurs CSS appropriés pour extraire les informations de la conversation."

If it's possible to tile the remaining squares, the graph must be such that each vertex has an even degree (i.e., an even number of edges connected to it).\n\nHowever, in this case, we can see that there are several vertices with an odd degree:\n\n* Vertex a8 is connected to vertices a7 and b8 (degree 2).\n* Vertex b8 is connected to vertices a8 and c8 (degree 2).\n* Vertex c8 is connected to vertices b8 and c7 (degree 2).\n* Vertex a7 is connected to vertices a8 and a6 (degree 2).\n* Vertex b7 is connected to vertices c7 and b6 (degree 2).\n* Vertex c7 is connected to vertices c8 and b7 (degree 2).\n* Vertex d7 is connected to vertices d6 and e6 (degree 2).\n* Vertex a6 is connected to vertices a7 and b6 (degree 2).\n* Vertex b6 is connected to vertices a6 and b7 (degree 2).\n* Vertex c6 is connected to vertices c5 and d6 (degree 2).\n* Vertex d6 is connected to vertices c6 and d7 (degree 2).\n* Vertex e6 is connected to vertices d7 and f5 (degree 2).\n* Vertex f6 has no connections (degree 0).\n* Vertex b5 is connected to vertices c5 and c6 (degree 2).\n* Vertex d5 is connected to vertices e5 and e4 (degree 2).\n* Vertex e5 is connected to vertices d5 and f4 (degree 2).\n* Vertex f5 is connected to vertices e6 and g5 (degree 2).\n* Vertex g5 is connected to vertices f5 and g4 (degree 2).\n* Vertex b4 is connected to vertices c4 and c3 (degree 2).\n* Vertex c4 is connected to vertices b4 and d4 (degree 2).\n* Vertex d4 is connected to vertices c4 and d5 (degree 2).\n* Vertex e4 is connected to vertices d5 and e3 (degree 2).\n* Vertex f4 is connected to vertices e5 and g4 (degree 2).\n* Vertex g4 is connected to vertices f4 and g5 (degree 2).\n* Vertex c3 is connected to vertices b4 and d3 (degree 2).\n* Vertex d3 is connected to vertices c3 and e3 (degree 2).\n* Vertex e3 is connected to vertices d3 and e4 (degree 2).\n* Vertex f3 is connected to vertices g3 and f2 (degree 2).\n* Vertex g3 is connected to vertices f3 and g2 (degree 2).\n* Vertex d2 is connected to vertices e2 and d1 (degree 2).\n* Vertex e2 is connected to vertices d2 and f1 (degree 2).\n* Vertex f2 is connected to vertices f3 and g1 (degree 2).\n\nThere are two vertices with an odd degree"

To tile a board with 2x1 dominoes, every vertex in the graph must have an even degree. In this case, vertex d5 with an odd degree of 3 prevents the possibility of tiling the given remaining squares with 2x1 dominoes."

The opponent (responding player) responds in a similar fashion. Once both players have placed their cards face down, the cards are revealed, and the winner of the card battle is determined.\n\nTo determine the winner, first add together the scores for each player's pair of cards in the category chosen by the lead player. The largest total wins. In the event of a draw, the responding player wins. The winner of the trick collects all the cards played into a single stack and places them on their winning pile. (Subsequent winning stacks should be placed perpendicular to the previous winning stack so that it is easy to determing how many winning stacks there are in the winning pile.)\n\nSpecial note about the N/A category:\nThe lead player cannot choose a category that contains N/A. The responding player may choose to play card(s) that contain N/A in the chosen category.

If they play 2 cards with N/A, they automatically win.\n\nThe winner of the trick also collects one of the two 'Trick Winner' tokens.

Lower NEFA–glycerol flux decreases hepatic acetylCoA and glycerol, thereby acutely diminishing gluconeogenesis (GNG), reflecting indirect insulin action (2). Direct hepatic IR activation stimulates glycogen synthesis (GLY) (3) and chronic transcriptional control via decreased FOXO1 to downregulate gluconeogenic enzymes and upregulate glucokinase (GK), increasing glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) levels (4). Inhibition of serine phosphorylation of GSK3 activates and increases glycogen synthase (GS) flux (3). Furthermore, glucose-6-phosphate allosterically activates glycogen synthase and inhibits glycogen phosphorylase (GP), resulting in glycogen storage and suppressed glucose production. Insulin further participates in protein synthesis via mTORC1 (5) and DNL via FOXO1, carbohydrate and sterol response element binding proteins (ChREBP and SREBP1c) (6). b, In insulinresistant states (obesity and T2D), adipocyte dysfunction—for example, owing to relative hypoxia induced by saturated fat-stimulated mitochondrial ANT2 triggering the transcription factor HIF-1α—leads to chemokine secretion, attracting macrophages (MΦ) (1). Immune cell infiltration inhibits adipocyte insulin sensitivity by mechanisms that ultimately increase lipolysis and NEFA and glycerol flux to the liver. Here, acetyl-CoA allosterically stimulates pyruvate carboxylase flux (PC), subsequently raising fasting glucose production (2). Increased lipid re-esterification generates DAG, thereby activating PKCε translocation and inhibitory Thr1160 phosphorylation of the IR (3) and increasing production of ceramides (4) and ROS (5), collectively promoting insulin resistance. Inhibiting direct hepatocellular insulin action acutely favours glycogenolysis and chronically upregulates gluconeogenesis with postprandial and finally continuous hyperglycaemia (6). In parallel, hepatic TAG deposition increases, not only from augmented lipid availability and DNL, partly controlled by insulin and FOXO1, but also via nutrient-sensitive pathways (ChREBP, SREBP1c and mTORC1) (7). Finally, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived factors (PKR-like eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and activating-transcription factor 6 (ATF6)) can induce an unfolded protein response, which may stimulate lipogenesis, supported by X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and inflammatory pathways. All of these mechanisms accelerate TAG accumulation and NAFLD progression.

However, the further application of ZnO anode is still faced with great challenges such as huge volume transformation and intrinsic low conductivity. Herein, we propose a simple strategy for the preparation of ZnO/carbon clusters (∼50 nm) which are assembled with uniformly distributed ZnO nanodots (∼5 nm) in the three-dimensional carbon nanofibers (ZnO/CNFs) through an electrospinning and subsequent carbonization process using gallic acid-zinc coordination polymer (GAZ) as precursor. The multi-dimensional assembly of ZnO nanodots and reticular formation of conductive carbon network can effectively alleviate the volume change of ZnO anode during long-term cycling process and promote the fast transfer of electrolyte ions/electrons, greatly improving the rate and cycle performance. As a result, the ZnO/CNFs electrode exhibits excellent rate performance of 375.3 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 and long cycling stability with capacity retention of 92% over 600 cycles at 1 A g−1.

Consistent with our ﬁndings, Zhu et al. (2020) reported that the addition of fermented feed improved the immune function for laying hens. The improved T helper type 1 and T helper type 2 cytokines may be attributed to the increased Lactobacillus abundance in FF group. Previous studies reported that Lactobacillus could improve the levels of T helper type 1 and T helper type 2 cytokines for mice (Lee et al., 2016), because their bacterial components, such as cell walls, peptidoglycans, and lipoteichoic acid, are immunologically active for organism (Cross et al., 2001). As crucial indicators for the intestinal health of animals, villus height and crypt depth directly affect the absorption capacity of intestinal mucosa. We observed increases in duodenal, jejunal and ileac villus height in hens fed a diet containing fermented feed, which was similar with Lv et al. (2022). Additionally, there was a trend towards increased crypt depth in the ileac samples from hens fed fermented feed. The enhanced intestinal villus height and crypt depth might result from the inhibition of Campylobacter and other pathogens by Lactobacillus, thus reducing the damage of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells.",

Here, we describe a simple yet robust ultrasonication-assisted Stille polymerization for accessing semiconducting polymers with high-precision tailored molecular weights (from low to ultrahigh molecular weight ranges) while mitigating their interbatch variations. We propose that ultrasound-induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers’ molecular weights with high reproducibility to satisfy all the optical/electrical and morphological demands of diverse types of high-performance semiconducting polymer-based devices; as demonstrated in in-depth experimental screenings in applications of both organic and perovskite photovoltaics.

Poly(butylene oxalate-co-furandicarboxylate) (PBOF) copolyesters were synthesized by precisely controlling the oxalic acid content from 10% to 60%. Compared with commercial PBAT, the barrier properties of PBOFs for H2O and O2 increased by more than 6 and 26 times, respectively. As the reduced water contact angle to from 82.5° to 62.9°, superior hydrophilicity gave PBOF an excellent degradation performance with a 35-day hydrolysis. Interestingly, PBO20F and PBO30F also displayed obvious weight loss during hydrolysis, with Mn less than 1/10 of the original values. Their elastic modulus (&gt;1 GPa) and tensile strength (35 and 54 MPa) exceeded those of HDPE and most biodegradable polymers. PBOF achieve the highest hydrolysis rates among the reported PBF-based copolyesters. The hydrolytic mechanism was further explored based on Fukui function analysis and density functional theory calculation. Noncovalent analysis indicated that the water molecules formed hydrogen bonding interaction with adjacent ester groups and thus improved the reactivity of carbonyl carbon. PBOF copolyesters meet the requirements of high-performance packaging market and can quickly degrade after usage, providing a new choice for green and environmental protection.",

For this, we report the preparation of light, mechanically durable, and effective photothermal material. A simple acid impregnation method was applied to graphene sponge material (GSM) possessing hydrophobic character to gain partial hydrophilicity to obtain a gradient structure. The morphological and structural properties of the gradient graphene sponge material (GGSM) were carried out using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction patterns, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, and water drop contact angle measurements. GGSM showed fast and effective water vapor conversion performance due to the gradient structure, as well as the high rate of sunlight absorption and photothermal conversion thanks to graphene. With the advantageous feature of gradient structure, GGSM achieved a high water vapor conversion capacity (1.79 kg/m2h) and solar thermal efficiency of 57% compared to GSM (1.58 kg/m2h; 45%). This new material provides a novel approach to solar energy applications.",

The peak position gradually shifts to 2078 cm−1 when the potential decreases to −1.0 V44,45 . It is noted that there are multiple distinct CO adsorption sites located in the region of 2000−2105 cm−1 , which are attributed to linearly bonded CO46 . In particular, the CO adsorption bands could been assigned to CO bound to step (~2089 cm−1 , high wavenumber), terrace sites (~2073 cm−1 , main component), and Cu(100) facets (~2058 cm−1 , low wavenumber), respectively. Meanwhile, the adsorbed CO bands appear at the identical position and potential on the surfaces of GNSs supported Cu2O catalysts (Fig. 4c). The calculated adsorption energy results indicate that CO prefers to adsorb onto the surfaces of Cu(100) and Cu2O(111) facets (Supplementary Fig. 27 and 28). The simulated IR spectra of CO adsorptions on the surfaces of Cu and Cu2O are in good agreement with the experimental SEIRA spectra. Noticeably, the vibrational intensity of adsorbed CO bands on the Cu2O catalysts using GNSs is signiﬁcantly enhanced compared to that using CDFs as the substrates. The REF of GNSs to CDFs is determined to be 2.4 ± 0.5 in 0.1 M HClO4 using CO as the probe molecule for the spectroscopic investigations on the surfaces of Cu2O catalysts. SEIRAS results in 0.5 M KHCO3 show similar trends to that in the acidic environment. The ECSAs for the Cu2O catalysts deposited on CDFs and GNSs are determined to be 2.22 and 0.98 cm2 in 0.5 M KHCO3, respectively (Fig. 4d). The vibrational intensity of adsorbed CO bands on the GNSs has been enhanced by 18.0 ± 1.3 times compared to that using the CDFs as the substrates in the neutral electrolyte (Fig. 4e, f)",

In this study, we proposed a novel technique that employs low-pressure assisted filtration to fabricate nanocomposite membranes using GO and melamine. Remarkably, these composite membranes exhibited outstanding separation performance for dyes (≥99.06 %) in organic solvents, regardless of their positive or negative charges or when present in mixtures. The optimum GO-M0.02 nanocomposite membrane exhibits impressive organic solvent flux (J), attaining a value as high as 50.8 L/m2h (acetone), which is 6.57 times greater than that of the pure GO membrane. Furthermore, these GO-Melamine nanocomposite membranes showed excellent durability against both common and harsh organic solvents, and the flux of solvents through the GO-M0.02 nanocomposite membrane remained almost unchanged even after being immersed in methanol for up to one week.

Therefore, soil K reserves are generally large [17] . Plants uptake K as cation (K+) and many sources of K are available in soils or provided as fertilizers, including potassium chloride (KCl), potassium nitrate (KNO3), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), and potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Among these forms, KCl, or muriate of potash, is the most inexpensive and most frequently used for agronomic crops, with some exceptions [19 ]. Other forms such as K2SO4 and KNO3 are used for some crops that are sensitive to chloride (Cl−), although they are expensive. For example, KCl causes leaf burn in tobacco due to its chloride ions [ 20]. However, the availability of K+ from soil or fertilizers depends on the soil texture, soil moisture content, pH, and some other factors. Apart from the common and soluble forms of K compounds, some forms such as K silicate minerals are also available in some soils. The availability of these compounds is very low, and in these cases, some microbes (especially bacteria and fungi) assist in solubilizing K and converting it into soluble forms through acidiﬁcation, chelation, and exchange reactions [ 21 ]. As a macronutrient, K is mostly applied as a basal dose to the soil. In some cases (e.g., sandy soil), K is applied as a foliar spray [ 22]. Foliar application is also very effective under waterlogged conditions [ 23 ]. However, the effectiveness of the foliar spray is dependent on the absorption capacity by and penetration into leaves; therefore, it can only partially compensate for insufﬁcient uptake by the roots.

In the present study, sulfur was substituted in versatile bismuth telluride thermoelectric material in subatomic ratio. The successful substitution in the resulting compounds, viz., Bi2Te2.85S0.15 and Bi2Te2.7S0.3, was confirmed using X-ray diffraction with Rietveld refinement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. High resolution-transmission electron microscopy showed an ultrathin platy morphology in nanopowder and a randomly oriented high grain density at nanometer scale in the consolidated pellet. The sulfur substitution resulted in polarity reversal and enhanced value of the Seebeck coefficient at subzero temperatures in the bismuth telluride matrix. This anomaly in the sign and value of the Seebeck coefficient was analyzed using temperature-dependent Hall measurement, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and first-principle computation using density functional theory coupled with Boltzmann transport theory. The analysis showed that the band-structure variations due to the localized polarity induced by the higher-electronegativity sulfur atom at TeI sites and suppression of antisite defects may be the prominent reasons for causing this anomaly.

Severe jellyfish stings could worsen cardiac function and even cause cardiac complications, ultimately leading to cardiac failure (CF). Currently, there are no effective drugs available. Single cell sequencing revealed alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG), an energy regulatory protein targeting to glycogen, was highly expressed in jellyfish stings-induced CF patients. However, the mechanism remains elusive. It is postulated that AAG could increase glycogen metabolism, protecting against jellyfish stings-induced CF. AAG deletion exacerbated CF, while exogenous and endogenous AAG ameliorated CF. AAG also rescued the decline triggered by the AAG knockout (KO). Intriguingly, AAG improved cardiac function and metabolic adaptation by glycogen-driven ATP production, shifting mitochondrial/glycolytic ATP production towards glycolysis. Sorted by single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcription technology, CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1α) were differentially expressed. Mechanistically, CCR5 inhibitor MVC abolished AAG's protective effect and PGC-1α overexpression. Collectively, jellyfish stings-induced CF was ameliorated through AAG-mediated glycogen-driven ATP production, promoting glycolytic/mitochondrial metabolic switches to rely energetically primarily on glycolysis, which might serve as a therapeutic target of CF.",

We use the softmax function as a continuous, differentiable approximation to arg max, and generate k-dimensional sample vectors y ∈ ∆k−1 where yi = exp((log(πi) + gi)/τ ) ∑k j=1 exp((log(πj ) + gj )/τ ) for i = 1, ..., k. (2) The density of the Gumbel-Softmax distribution (derived in Appendix B) is: pπ,τ (y1, ..., yk) = Γ(k)τ k−1 ( k∑ i=1 πi/yτ i )−k k∏ i=1 (πi/yτ +1 i ) (3) This distribution was independently discovered by Maddison et al. (2016), where it is referred to as the concrete distribution. As the softmax temperature τ approaches 0, samples from the GumbelSoftmax distribution become one-hot and the Gumbel-Softmax distribution becomes identical to the categorical distribution p(z).expectation a) Categorical category sampleb) τ = 0.1 τ = 0.5 τ = 1.0 τ = 10.0 Figure 1: The Gumbel-Softmax distribution interpolates between discrete one-hot-encoded categorical distributions and continuous categorical densities. (a) For low temperatures (τ = 0.1, τ = 0.5), the expected value of a Gumbel-Softmax random variable approaches the expected value of a categorical random variable with the same logits. As the temperature increases (τ = 1.0, τ = 10.0), the expected value converges to a uniform distribution over the categories. (b) Samples from GumbelSoftmax distributions are identical to samples from a categorical distribution as τ → 0. At higher temperatures, Gumbel-Softmax samples are no longer one-hot, and become uniform as τ → ∞. 2.1 GUMBEL-SOFTMAX ESTIMATOR The Gumbel-Softmax distribution is smooth for τ > 0, and therefore has a well-deﬁned gradient ∂y/∂π with respect to the parameters π. Thus, by replacing categorical samples with GumbelSoftmax samples we can use backpropagation to compute gradients (see Section 3.1). We denote 1The Gumbel(0, 1) distribution can be sampled using inverse transform sampling by drawing u ∼ Uniform(0, 1) and computing g = − log(− log(u)). 2",

A Y-groove joint preparation with included angles (IA) of 16°, 24°, and 30° and root face of 2.5 mm was used. Welding was performed using M250 W2 filler wire. The heat input for welding increased as the IA increased. The composition of weld fusion zone affected the reverted austenite (RA) volume fraction formed on aging. With an increase in base metal melting, the fusion zone was enriched with solute elements such as Ni, Mo, and Ti, ultimately increasing RA after aging. The fusion zone hardness of joints 1 and 2 was in the range 500–550 HV. The fusion zone of joint 3 exhibited a lower hardness of 475–525 HV due to the increased heat input involved in making the joint. When the transverse tensile strength of all welds was comparable to that of the parent metal, a significant reduction in KIc fracture toughness of fusion zone (FZ) was observed as the RA increased. KIc fracture toughness values were in the order, base &gt; joint 1 &gt; joint 2 &gt; joint 3.

An imbalance in its structure can result in an immune reaction in the intestinal microenvironment or allow unrestrained growth and leakage of bacteria, leading to various diseases. The signiﬁcance of the gut barrier in disease pathogenesis has recently attracted attention, since a compromised barrier function has been observed in both intestinal and systemic disorders [2]. The traditional view that deﬁnes increased permeability as a mere consequence of disease processes is now outdated. Instead, disruption of the gut barrier is seen as a causative agent of these conditions. It mainly leads to the systemic dissemination of gut luminal contents, and thus affects tissue function either directly or indirectly. Increasing evidence supports an essential and causative role of gut barrier disruption not only in intestinal disorders such as celiac disease [3] and inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) [4] but also in the development of liver diseases including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis [5–7], in metabolic syndrome [8,9], and in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [10–13].

This type of damage is caused by stresses, due to settlement, overloading, earthquakes, thermal cycles or fatigue. These stresses cause cracks and/or deformations. The paper concentrates on the most characteristic patterns, which can be directly connected with their origin. In some cases weak and non homogenous parts of the building are, because of their vulnerability, prone to undergo damaging mechanisms. At these places an earthquake could accelerate the appearance of damage. An example can be found in the case when two adjacent buildings become separated due to an earthquake (Fig. 1).

Bimetallic coordination nanoparticles are composed of three functional modules: dopamine, Ru(dcbpy)3Cl2 and GdCl3, which are connected through 1,4-Bis[(1H-imidazole-1-yl)methyl]benzene (BIX). Their morphology can be easily controlled by adjusting the ratio of precursors.

Furthermore, the targeting of homologous cancer cell membranes enables these coordinated nanoparticles to precisely target tumor cells. The MR imaging capabilities and the combination of PDT and PTT were demonstrated in in vitro experiments. In addition, in vivo experiments indicated that the nanoplatform showed excellent tumor accumulation and therapeutic effects on mice with subcutaneous tumors, and could effectively eliminate tumors within 14 days. Therefore, it expanded the new horizon for the preparation of modular nanoplatform and imaging-guided optical therapy of tumors.",

The degradation of a-Si:H films under light irradiation, known as StaeblerWronski (S–W) effect [9], has been identified as one of the most significant factors affecting the reliability of thin film solar cells and modules [10–12]. However, the thickness of intrinsic and doped a-Si:H films in SHJ solar cell is significantly lower than that of thin film solar cell, which may make the degradation mechanism totally different from S–W effect. It is important to understand the performance changes and physical mechanism of SHJ solar cell and module under light exposure. When an intrinsic a-Si:H (a-Si:H(i)) layer is deposited on the n-type wafer, light exposure influences the surface recombination and causes a light-induced degradation at the interface [13,14].

In this work, a double-peak age hardening was observed in the LPBF-processed Al-5Mg-2Si-3Zn alloy, in which the higher hardness value was 176 HV for the second peak and the lower hardness was 169 HV for the first peak. The yield strength was remarkably enhanced from the 349 MPa under as-built condition to the 434 MPa under as-aged condition. It was found that the double peak hardening was highly associated with Zn alloying, which promoted the formation of Zn segregation with overlapping of nanoscale eutectic Mg2Si cells in the as-built state. The aged microstructures were characterized by the uniformly distributed Zn solute and the precipitation of the secondary lath-shaped β″ phase, which is responsible for the first peak age strengthening. Further, the pre-existed β″ in conjunction with the newly formed needle-shaped (Mg, Zn)-rich Guinier-Preston (GP) zone and plate-shaped η′ precipitates co-contribute to the strengthening in the second peak. The synergistic strengthening of multiple precipitates is very effective and efficient for the development of additively manufactured aluminium alloys.",

The crashworthiness performance of glass fiber-reinforced polymer composite pipes manufactured using the filament winding is investigated in detail. The effects of the winding angle of the fibers and thickness of the tube wall on the energy absorption were examined through quasi-static compression tests. The composite pipes were produced with 1200 tex E-glass fibers and Epikote 828 resin as the matrix material. The winding angles of ± 30°, ± 45°, ± 55°, ± 75°, and ± 90° were evaluated, and the number of the winding layers, ranged from 1 to 3, was also assessed. Quasi-static axial compressive loading was applied to 15 specimens using a hydraulic actuator. The results revealed that the one-layer specimens experienced buckling damage at low load levels, while an increase in the number of the layers led to higher load-carrying capacity and different types of damages. Furthermore, as the number of the layers increased, the load-carrying capacity and energy absorption of the specimens significantly improved. Progressive failure was observed in the specimens [± 90] for all the layers' configurations, with the specimen [± 90]3, having three layers, exhibiting the highest performance in terms of the load-carrying capacity and energy absorption. The failure modes indicated a combination of the fibers' separation, buckling, diagonal shear failure, and crushing in the upper and lower heads.",

The polyacrylates possessing urea, urethane, N-substituted urea, or carbonate groups are prepared by the free radical polymerization of acrylate monomers possessing the corresponding functional groups. The presence of stronger hydrogen bonding interactions both in bulk and solutions of a highly polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is supported by the infrared (IR) spectra, whereas the urethane-based polyacrylate does not exhibit the interaction in the solution. The presence of the stronger hydrogen bonding interactions of the urea unit is discussed by the IR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and the density functional theory calculations of the corresponding model compounds. The solubility in organic solvents and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymers are also dependent on the structure of the pendant groups. Polar aprotic solvents such as DMSO can only dissolve the urea-based polyacrylate, while the other polymers are soluble in a much wider range of solvents such as tetrahydrofuran.

The microstructure and elemental composition of the obtained coatings were analyzed using SEM, EDS, XRD and FTIR. The corrosion resistance of the coated samples was evaluated using potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and salt spray test. The results indicated that the addition of NaOH significantly influenced the morphology as well as the thickness of the prepared LDH coating. The effect of different Al–Mn phase contents of AZ31 and AM30 alloy on the growth mechanism of the LDH coatings was discussed. The addition of 0.01 M NaOH promoted the growth of the LDH coating on AZ31 and AM30 alloys. The AM30-NaOH-0.01 sample possessed the most compact and uniform surfaces as well as the maximum thickness. The corrosion current density of the samples was reduced by three orders of magnitude compared to their substrates.
