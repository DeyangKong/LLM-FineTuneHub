Despite the\ncumulenic delocalization of the positive charges, 1 2+ shows substantial\nelectrophilicity at the dicoordinate carbon centre. It is amenable to\ntwo successive nucleophilic attacks, in line with the existence of two\naccessible coordination sites at the central carbon. We also show that\nit can participate in an unprecedented reversible two-electron redox\nsystem with parent bis(imino)carbene, fully consistent with its descrip-\ntion as a doubly oxidized bis(imino)carbene. This work demonstrates\nthat bulky strong electron-donor substituents can be used both to\nmask vacant orbitals at the central carbon atom and to prevent the two\nanions from coordination, paving the way for the isolation of a variety\nof doubly oxidized carbenes.\nOnline content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summa-\nries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowl-\nedgements, peer review information; details of author contributions\nand competing interests; and statements of data and code availability\nare available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06539-x.\n1.

This technique includes silencing the expression of both the\nmutant RHO allele and its wild-type (WT) counterpart and simultaneously adding an exogenous WT\nRHO gene beyond the regulation of the retina in vivo (Mitra et al., 2018; Cideciyan et al., 2018;\nTsai et al., 2018). Although these methods are applicable to RHO-adRP, many risks remain with the\ndisruption of the WT allele. Recently, allele-specific methods have been used extensively to treat\nadRP (Meng et al., 2020). With the aim of allele-specific RHO gene downregulation at the RNA\nlevel using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), short hairpin RNA, or RNA interference (Meng et al.,\n2020) can be achieved, some of which have been translated into clinical trials. However, repeated\ntreatments, especially for subretinal injections, are bound to hamper therapeutic effectiveness. In\ncomparison, allele-specific mutant DNA targeting approaches, specifically with the CRISPR/Cas9\nsystem (Mali et al., 2013; Ran et al., 2015), which leads to permanent DNA modification, may be\nmore promising. In fact, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used extensively to treat adRP caused\nby RHO-P23H, S334ter, P347S mutations, etc. This resulted in the delay in photoreceptor degener-\nation and rescue of retinal function in animal models (Latella et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018; Giannelli\net al., 2018; Patrizi et al., 2021; Bakondi et al., 2016). However, these proof-of-concept studies\nare not suitable for direct translation into clinical practice. Therefore, there is currently no approved\ntreatment for adRP",

Samples were collected weekly\nfor image analysis, quantification of SVI 5, particle\nsize and sludge biomass to monitor the granulation\nprocess, and five distinct phases of granular devel-\nopment were defined (Figure 1). At the point of\ninoculation, the floccular biomass had a mean\nparticle diameter of 60 mm (50th percentile distribution).\nFigure 1 Developmental process of granular sludge community in a sequencing batch reactor based on microscopic visualization of\nstructures (a), particle size distribution (measured on a volume basis) and SVI 5 (b), and sludge biomass concentration (c).

In (b), 10th percentile (open circle), 50th percentile (open square) and 90th percentile (open triangle) indicate\nthat 10%, 50% and 90% of total particles were below the corresponding size distribution, respectively; while SVI 5 (filled triangle)\nmeasures the compactness of the sludge particles. Concentration of sludge biomass (c), in terms of mixed liquor suspended solids (open\nsquare) and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (filled square), were also determined. The dotted line separates the different\ndevelopmental phases of granulation, that is, phases I–V.\nQuorum sensing and community assembly\nCH Tan et al\n1189\nThe ISME Journal\nThis was followed by the reduction of the sludge\nsettling-time from 60 to 5 min to select for high\ndensity sludge biomass, where a 40% loss in\nbiomass (mixed liquor volatile suspended solids\ndecreased from 3000 to 1820 mg l ? 1 ) and a 70%\nreduction in biomass volume (SVI5 decreased from\n300 to 106 ml g ? 1 ) were observed (phase I; weeks\n0–5). Compact aggregates developed in the bioreac-\ntor by week 8 as the mean particle size increased\nfrom 60 to 180 mm and SVI 5 decreased markedly to\no50 ml g ? 1 (phase II; weeks 5–8). This suggests that\nthe biomass was undergoing granulation. Weeks\n8–15 (phase III) were characterized by a dramatic\nincrease in the mean particle size from 180 to\n850 mm. Granule size remained steady at 850 mm for\nthe subsequent 5 weeks (phase IV; weeks 15–20). At\nweek 20, the mature granules disintegrated into\nfloccular biomass with the mean particle size\ndecreased to 200 mm and SVI 5 increased to 89 ml g ? 1\n(phase V; weeks 20–22), thus completing the granule\nlife cycle. In terms of reactor performance, removal\nof total nitrogen and phosphorus were rather erratic\nduring the transition from phase I to II where loss of\nbiomass occurred. However, stable and high removal\nefficiency for both nitrogen (that is, 85±7%) and\nphosphorus (that is, 95±11%) were achieved once\nthe compact aggregates were formed and increased\nin biomass at phase IV. Although the phosphorus\nremoval efficiency was maintained during the\ndispersal phase (phase V), removal of total nitrogen\nbecame unstable at this point (that is, 76±25%).\nAHL concentration positively correlates with\ngranulation\nThe specific AHLs and their concentrations in the\nmixed microbial community during granulation\nwere determined from sludge supernatant extracts\nby HPLC-MS/MS. Identification and quantification\nwere based on standard curves and the mass spectra\nof 13 different synthetic AHLs as quantitative\nreferences (Supplementary Figure S1). The extrac-\ntion efficiency for each of the 13 standards was\nexperimentally determined (between 50% and\n80%), and was factored into the quantification of\nthe AHLs. AHLs ranging from C4 to C8 were\ndetected at different stages of the granulation\nprocess, whereas AHLs with 10 carbons or more\nwere not resolved within the detection limit (0.2–2\npmol g ? 1 after sample concentration and biomass\nnormalization) (Figure 2a). 3OC8-HSL was the most\nabundant signal, 5- to 30-fold higher than the other\nAHLs. The amount of 3OC8-HSL in the sludge\nsupernatant, after biomass normalization, was esti-\nmated to be 6–325 pmol g ? 1 (Figure 2a), or 10–210\np M equivalent (Supplementary Figure S2). The\namount of C4–C8 AHLs, per gram of sludge biomass,\nincreased 10- to 100-fold during phase II as\ncompared with phase I (Po0.05 for all AHLs)\n(Figure 2a), corresponding with the initiation of\ngranule formation (Figure 1). When the relationship\nbetween AHLs and granulation at different devel-\nopmental phases was determined using Pearson\ncorrelation, all AHLs were strongly and positively\ncorrelated with sludge particle size (as a granulation\nmeasure) during the phase I–II transition (r40.8567,\nPo0.007; minimum ‘r’ and maximum ‘P’ values for\nall AHLs) (Figure 2b). The concentration of some\nAHLs, for example, C4-HSL and C6-HSL, continued\nto increase during phase III, whereas other AHLs, for\nexample, 3OC6-HSL, C7-HSL, C8-HSL and 3OC8-\nHSL, decreased 5- to 10-fold during the same phase\n(Figure 2a). A second rise in all AHL levels was\nobserved at the maintenance phase (phase IV) and\nthe levels of AHLs declined or were below the\ndetection limit at the time when the granules started\nto disperse (phase V) (Figure 2a). The amounts of\nC6-HSL and C8-HSL, in particular, were found to\ndecrease significantly (C6-HSL: 23.0±0.2 vs\n2.0±1.3 pmol g ? 1 , P ¼ 0.0015; C8-HSL: 3.0±0.2 vs\n0.03±0.0 pmol g ? 1 , P ¼ 0.0037) (Figure 2a) and were\nstrongly correlated with the sludge particle size\nduring granule disintegration or phase IV–V transi-\ntion (C6-HSL: r ¼ 0.7983, P ¼ 0.0550; C8-HSL:\nr ¼ 0.7670, P ¼ 0.0714) (Figure 2b). The levels of\nthe remaining AHLs, for example, C4-HSL, C7-HSL,\n3OC6-HSL and 3OC8-HSL, also declined during the\ndispersal period but the differences were not\nsignificant (P40.05) (Figure 2a). Thus, high con-\ncentrations of AHLs were associated with granule\nformation and low levels of particular AHLs were\nassociated with granule collapse (Figure 2b).\nExpression of EPS correlates with granulation and AHL\nproduction\nEPS, a key component of biofilms and granules,\nwas characterized and quantified based on poly-\nsaccharide and protein content. Both polysaccha-\nrides and proteins increased in amount as the\nfloccular biomass began to transform into granules\n(phase I–II; polysaccharides: 13.2±2.5 vs 27.3±\n8.1 mg g ? 1 , Po0.0001; proteins: 72.4±8.5 vs\n110.4±13.7 mg g ? 1 , Po0.0001) (Figures 3a and b).\nThe amount of protein showed a slight decline in\nphase III and remained relatively stable thereafter\n(100.1±4.4 mg g ? 1 ) (Figure 3b). In contrast, the\namount of polysaccharides declined during phases\nIV and V, returning to the initial concentration\nobserved for the floccular sludge (21.1±1.1 vs\n13.9±2.3 mg g ? 1 , P ¼ 0.0452) (Figure 3a). Consistent\nwith the polysaccharide profile, the polysaccharide\nto protein ratio (PS/PN) increased during phase I–II\ntransition (0.18±0.02 vs 0.24±0.04, P ¼ 0.0070) and\ndecreased during phase IV–V transition (0.22±0.01\nvs 0.13±0.03, P ¼ 0.0025) (Figure 3c). For the latter\ntransition, the PS/PN ratio decreased to 0.13±0.03,\na ratio that was comparable with the EPS composi-\ntion of the floccular biomass. The PS/PN ratio\nshowed a strong positive Pearson correlation with\nthe sludge particle si",

Although such studies have focused\non populations of bacteria in the laboratory, bacteria\nin natural and man-made environments mainly exist\nas phylogenetically highly diverse and complex\ncommunities (Kolter and Greenberg, 2006). These\ncommunities are unlike those of population derived\nassemblages, with community members differen-\ntially experiencing fluctuations in a wide range of\nparameters, including pH, temperature, nutrient\nconcentration, oxygen level and diffusion/dilution\nof signals (Boyer and Wisniewski-Dye´, 2009; Decho\net al., 2009; Yeon et al., 2009). Despite these\nchallenges, it is now increasingly clear that QS\noccurs in and appears to be highly relevant for\ncomplex communities, whether they are biofilms on\nrocks in streams (McLean et al., 1997), stromatolites\n(Decho et al., 2009) or biofilms formed on hollow\nfibre membranes in bioreactors (Yeon et al., 2009).\nFor example, the concentration of AHLs in a\nmicrobial mat was shown to vary with the diel\ncycle, driven by pH changes as a function of\ncommunity metabolism and photosynthesis (Decho\net al., 2009). However, the role of QS signalling in\nmicrobial communities remains poorly understood\nboth in terms of how the signals may impact on\ncommunity assembly and the function or interaction\nof the community members.\nA microbial granulation system was used in this\nstudy as a model ecosystem for complex microbial\ncommunity assembly. Granulation is an emerging\nnutrient removal biotechnology, which enables\ndecentralized low energy, cost effective and sustain-\nable water treatment (Liu and Tay, 2004). Our\ngranulation ecosystem has many advantages in that\nkey process parameters, including dissolved oxygen\nconcentrations, pH, temperature, carbon, nitrogen\nand phosphorus concentrations, as well as the\nconversion of the floccular biomass into dense,\nhighly structured granules can be precisely con-\ntrolled and quantified. Acquiring this metadata\nset allows for the simultaneous and integrated\ninvestigation of environmental factors impacting\non the production, accumulation, maintenance and\nfunctional role of AHL signals in the microbial\ncommunity. Using this model ecosystem and a\ncombination of analytical chemistry, metatranscrip-\ntomics and ecology study approaches, we have\ninvestigated the role of AHL based QS signalling\nin the assembly and morphogenesis of a highly\ncomplex granular sludge community.\nMaterials and methods\nBioreactor operation\nA sequencing batch reactor, seeded with floccular\nsludge community (Zhou et al., 2010), was operated\nfor 154 days at 22 1C under conditions selecting for\nthe formation of microbial granules (Supplementary\nMaterials and Methods). The bioreactor operation\ninvolved a 6 h cycle with two continuous phases of\nfeeding, anaerobic, aerobic and anoxic periods.\nA total of 2 l synthetic wastewater (Zhou et al.,\n2010) was fed to the bioreactor during the feeding\nstages and 2 l of treated effluent was discharged at the\nend of the cycle, giving a hydraulic retention time of\n12 h. The granulation process was monitored on a\nweekly basis. Concentrations of sludge biomass,\nincluding mixed liquor suspended solids and mixed\nliquor volatile suspended solids, as well as concen-\ntrations of ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and orthopho-\nsphate were determined using APHA standard\nengineering methods (Eaton et al., 2005). Sludge\nparticle size was determined using a laser particle\nsize analysis system (Malvern Mastersizer,\nSingapore). Morphology of the sludge particles was\nobserved under a dissecting microscope (Olympus\nSZX2-ILLT, Singapore). Sludge volumetric index at\n5 min (SVI5), which measures sludge density/com-\npactness, was determined as described by Liu (2008).\nOne millilitre aliquots of mixed sludge suspension\nwere collected by the end of the anoxic stage. The\nsludge biomass was collected at 8000 g for 5 min and\nstored at ? 80 1C immediately for subsequent RNA\nand extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) analy-\nsis. Similarly, 50 ml aliquots of treated effluent were\nkept at ? 80 1C immediately after sampling for later\nextraction of AHLs.\nChemicals\nThe following synthetic AHLs (497%) were purchased\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich (Singapore): N-butyryl-DL-homo-\nserine lactone (C4-HSL), N-hexanoyl-DL-homoserine\nlactone (C6-HSL), N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-DL-homoserine\nlactone (3OC6-HSL), N-heptanoyl-DL-homoserine lac-\ntone (C7-HSL), N-octanoyl-DL-homoserine lactone\n(C8-HSL), N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone\n(3OC8-HSL), N-decanoyl-DL-homoserine lactone (C10-\nHSL), N-(3-oxodecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3OC10-\nHSL), N-dodecanoyl-DL-homoserine lactone (C12-HSL),\nN-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3OC12-\nHSL), N-(3-hydroxydodecanoyl)-DL-homoserine lac-\ntone (3OHC12-HSL), N-tetradecanoyl-DL-homoserine\nlactone (C14-HSL) and N-(3-oxotetradecanoyl)-L-\nhomoserine lactone (3OC14-HSL).\nDetection of AHLs by high performance liquid\nchromatography/tandem mass spectrometry\n(HPLC-MS/MS)\nExtraction of AHLs from treated effluents (bulk liquid/\nsludge supernatants) were conducted as described by\nShaw et al. (1997). Briefly, 50 ml of the supernatants\nQuorum sensing and community assembly\nCH Tan et al\n1187\nThe ISME Journal\nwere extracted twice with two volumes of dichlor-\nomethane. The dichloromethane extracts were con-\ncentrated and resuspended in 50 ml of methanol:\nwater (1:1 v/v) before analysis by HPLC-MS/MS\n(Shimadzu, Singapore). All samples were chromato-\ngraphed by HPLC (XR-ODS C18 column) at a flow\nrate of 0.3 ml min ? 1 . The mobile phase consisted of\na linear gradient (40–95%) of solvent B (methanol\nwith 0.1% formic acid) and solvent A (25 mM\nammonium formate with 0.1% formic acid). Efflu-\nents were ionized by electrospray ionization under\npositive mode and detected using the multiple\nreaction monitoring approach (Morin et al., 2003;\nDecho et al., 2009). Matrix-matched multiple\nreaction monitoring experiments were conducted\nfor all 13 standard AHLs (Supplementary Table S1).\nEach standard multiple reaction monitoring profile,\nincluding specific LC retention time, appearance of\nprecursor ion m/z and two transition ions, as well as\nrelative intensity of the two transition ions, was used\nas a reference. To confirm the identity of the putative\nAHLs, a full scan, ranging from m/z 100 to 350,\ncoupled with precursor ion scan mode was con-\nducted in comparison with the standards. The\nextraction efficiency for each AHL was estimated\nbased on the recovery of the standards at two\ndifferent concentrations, 5 and 50 mg l ? 1\n, added to\nthe heat-inactivated sludge supernatant sample\nmatrix.\nQuantification of AHLs by HPLC-MS/MS\nFor AHL quantification, matrix-matched standard\ncurves, ranging from 0.5 to 200 mg l ? 1 , were\nconstructed. Two transition ions, characteristic of\nthe respective AHLs, were used to identify the AHL\nand the transition ion with the highest intensity\nwas employed to construct the standard curves\n(Supplementary Table S1). The analyte peak areas\nwere integrated using LabSolutions (Shimadzu).\nThe limits of detection and quantification for each\nAHL were calculated with a signal-to-noise ratio of\n3.3 and 10, respectively. Triplicate blank injections\nwere performed between sample injections to avoid\nsample carry over.\nEPS analysis\nExtraction of EPS from the sludge biomass was\nperformed as described by Adav and Lee (2007),\nwith some modifications. Briefly, 1 ml of mixed\nsludge suspension was collected at 8000 g for 5 min.\nThe sludge biomass was ground gently with a clean\nglass rod to disrupt the granular particles and\nsubjected to freeze-drying for 24 h. The dried\nbiomass was recorded. The samples were resus-\npended in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl (w/v) solution with\n0.6% formaldehyde (v/v) for 1 h at 4 1C. Four\nhundred microliters of 1 M NaOH were added to\nthe sludge suspension for 3 h at 4 1C before collect-\ning EPS at 17 000 g for 15 min at 4 1C. The\npolysaccharide (PS) component of EPS was mea-\nsured using the phenol-sulfuric acid assay with\nglucose as the standard (Dubois et al., 1956),\nwhereas the protein (PN) component was quantified\nby the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum\nalbumin as the standard (Smith et al., 1985).\nAHL add-back studies\nTwo liters of floccular sludge, used to seed the\ngranulation bioreactor, was collected (Zhou et al.,\n2010). The sludge biomass was washed three times\nwith 0.9% NaCl solution before the exposure of\nfresh synthetic wastewater. Forty mililiters of the\nsludge suspension were distributed to the indivi-\ndual flasks, followed by the addition of 40 ml\nexogenous AHLs, for example, C6-HSL, C8-HSL,\nC12-HSL, 3OC6-HSL, 3OC8-HSL and 3OC12-HSL,\nto a final concentration of 100 or 5000 n M . DMSO\nwas included as the negative control. For each\ntreatment, three biological replicates were per-\nformed. The culture flasks were incubated at\n100 r.p.m. for 1 h at 22 1C. Two aliquots of 1 ml\nmixed sludge suspension were sampled from each\nflask at time 0 and 1 h. The sludge biomass was\ncollected at 8000 g for 5 min and snap-frozen with\nliquid nitrogen before the storage at ? 80 1C for\nfurther EPS analysis. Measurements of mixed liquor\nsuspended solids and mixed liquor volatile sus-\npended solids were taken for each flask at the\nbeginning and the end of the experiment. Two-way\nANOVA and Bonferroni tests were conducted for\nstatistical analysis.\nMetatranscriptomic studies\nTotal RNA was extracted from sludge using FastRNA\nPro Soil-Direct kit (MP Biomedicals, Singapore)\naccording to the manufacturer’s guidelines and DNA\nwas removed using the TURBO DNA-free kit\n(Applied Biosystems, Singapore). RNA quality was\ndetermined using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser and\nreported as RNA integrity number. The quantity of\ntotal RNA and residual DNA was measured by\nQuant-iT RiboGreen RNA and PicoGreen DNA assays\n(Invitrogen, Singapore), respectively. Total RNA,\n200 ng, was used for complimentary DNA (cDNA)\nlibrary preparation according to the manufacturer’s\ninstructions (Illumina, Singapore). Each cDNA library\nwas ligated with a unique adaptor sequence for\nsample multiplexing. A total of 16 different cDNA\nlibraries were pooled and sequenced by Miseq System\n(Illumina).\nSequence analysis\nTotal RNA sequencing data were analyzed using a\nfast tag-based method developed here. This PCR free\napproach has the advantage of minimizing amplifi-\ncation bias (Logares et al., 2013). Briefly, a universal\nprimer (CGACRRCCATGCANCACCT) for the 16S\nQuorum sensing and community assembly\nCH Tan et al\n1188\nThe ISME Journal\nrRNA hypervariable region (V6) was used to scan\neach sequencing read to obtain 33 nucleotide (nt)\nsequences downstream of the primer, and the 33 nt\nsequences are defined as the V6 tag of the 16S rRNA\ngene. Short reads not able to cover the full 33 nt\nregion were discarded. The universal primer\nmatches 94% of 16S rRNA sequences in the RDP\ndatabase (Claesson et al., 2010). Each different V6\ntag is used as a signature sequence to represent one\noperational taxonomic unit. To eliminate sequen-\ncing error derived V6 tags, only V6 tags that were\nobserved in at least two different reads were kept for\nanalysis, and V6 tags were removed when any single\ntype of sequencing read accounted for X50% of all\nreads covering that V6 tag to eliminate sequencing\nartifacts where identical duplicated reads were\ngenerated from single templates.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using Prism\n(GraphPad) or R (www.r-project.org). ANOVAs,\nBonferroni and Tukey tests were conducted to\nexamine differences between various granulation\nphases and adjusted P-values were reported.\nPearson correlation coefficients were determined\nand false discovery rate corrections were made for\nall multiple correlations and adjusted P-values were\nreported. The correlation matrixes were clustered\nusing unsupervised hierarchical clustering method\nbased on Euclidean distance with complete linkage\nas coded by Cluster 3.0 and visualized using Java\nTreeView.\nResults\nDevelopment of a complex, functional granular sludge\ncommunity\nGranules are defined as compact aggregates that are\ncharacterized with a minimum particle size of\n100 mm in diameter and have a SVI 5 (a measure of\nbiomass density/compactness) of 50 ml g ? 1 or less\n(Barr et al., 2010). Samples were collected weekly\nfor image analysis, quantification of SVI 5, particle\nsize and sludge biomass to monitor the granulation\nprocess, and five distinct phases of granular devel-\nopment were defined (Figure 1). At the point of\ninoculation, the floccular biomass had a mean\nparticle diameter of 60 mm (50th percentile distribution).\nFigure 1 Developmental process of granular sludge community in a sequencing batch reactor based on microscopic visualization of\nstructures (a), particle size distribution (measured on a volume basis) and SVI 5 (b), and sludge biomass concentration (c). Magnification\nin (a) ? 15 (bar, 500 mm). In (b), 10th percentile (open circle), 50th percentile (open square) and 90th percentile (open triangle) indicate\nthat 10%, 50% and 90% of total particles were below the corresponding size distribution, respectively; while SVI 5 (filled triangle)\nmeasures the compactness of the sludge particles. Concentration of sludge biomass (c), in terms of mixed liquor suspended solids (open\nsquare) and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (filled square), were also determined.

From a crystallo-\r\ngraphic point of view, 1 has 16 symmetry elements (2σv, 2σd,\r\n2C2′, 2C2″, E, 2C4, C2, i, 2S4, σh,) at HTP, while it only has 4\r\n(E, C2, σv, σv) at RTP. As the temperature decreases, the\r\nobvious symmetry breaking with 4/mmmFmm2 generates 4\r\n(16/4) equivalent directions at RTP. Moreover, the N−H···I\r\nhydrogen bonds at HTP possess higher symmetry compared\r\nwith that of ITP and RTP (Tables S2−S4), which can be seen\r\nas another evidence for the occurrence of symmetry breaking\r\nin 1. The symmetry change belongs to one of the Aizu 88\r\nspecies and is consistent well with the Landau phase transition\r\ntheory.42\r\n2.3. Ferroelectric and Semiconducting Properties.\r\nVariable-temperature second harmonic generation (SHG)\r\nmeasurements were carried out to check its symmetry breaking\r\nduring the successive structural transformations. Under the\r\nirradiation of a femtosecond laser, 1 shows an obvious\r\nfrequency-doubled effect at RTP but has no SHG signal at\r\nITP and HTP (Figure 2d), indicating the occurrence of\r\nsymmetry breaking in the cooling mode. These two structural\r\nphase transitions were also confirmed by variable-temperature\r\nPXRD measurements (Figure S9). At RTP, organic\r\nammonium cations show an obvious shift along the c-axis,\r\ndisplaying a net polarization (Figure S0). The well-shaped\r\nrectangular polarization versus electric field (P−E) hysteresis\r\nloop was collected at 295 K (Figure 2e), which indicates its\r\nstrong room-temperature ferroelectricity (∼4.8 μC/cm2). The\r\nlarge Ps could be beneficial to achieve self-powered\r\nchemiresistive sensing at room temperature as the built-in\r\nelectric field could promote charge separation and simulta-\r\nneously enhance charge carrier diffusion. Furthermore, the\r\nlinear P−E lines disclose its paraelectric properties in ITP and\r\nHTP (the green and red line in Figure 2e, respectively). In\r\ngeneral, the semiconducting property of the material is\r\nessential for the chemiresistive sensing. The band gap of 1\r\nwas estimated to be ∼1.86 eV according to the ultraviolet−\r\nvisible absorption spectrum (Figure 2f). First-principles\r\ncalculations were further performed to explore its electronic\r\nband structure. The minimum of the conduction band (CBM)\r\nand the maximum of the valence band (VBM) are coherently\r\nlocated at the G point, exhibiting a direct band gap (Figure\r\nS11). The theoretical band gap of ∼1.83 eV is in good\r\naccordance with the experimental data. The small band gap of\r\n1 will be of great benefit to achieve strong optical polarization\r\ncoupling and considerable photoactivities, such as ferroelectric\r\nphotovoltaics. From the partial density of states, it is observed\r\nthat the Pb 6p orbit offers the CBM, while the I 5s and Pb 6s\r\norbit dominates the VBM (Figure S12). Furthermore,\r\nHOMO−LUMO orbital analyses indicate that the inorganic\r\nframeworks dominate the VBM and CBM, which reveals that\r\nthe semiconducting property of 1 nearly originates from its Pb-\r\nI layered frameworks (Figure 2g).\r\n2.4. Ferroelectric Photovoltaic Effect. Here, current−\r\nvoltage (I−V) measurements were carried out on the single\r\ncrystal along the c-axis to investigate its photoactive behaviors.\r\nAs shown in Figure 3a, the I−V curves depicted an obvious\r\nferroelectric photovoltaic effect with the incident illumination\r\nof 435 nm, including Vopen and Ishort. To be more specific, the\r\nIshort was measured to be ∼1.27 μA/cm2 under the illumination\r\nof 163.5 mW/cm2. Such a value is comparable with that of the\r\nclassic inorganic ferroelectric BiFeO3 (∼0.4 μA/cm2)43 and\r\nmuch larger than that of some other oxides, such as\r\n(K1/2Na1/2)(Mn1/200Nb199/200)O3 (0.021 μA/cm2), (Na,\r\nK)NbO3 (∼0.025 μA/cm2), Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (∼0.0034 μA/\r\ncm2), and (Pb, La)(Zr,Ti)O3 (∼0.008 μA/cm2), under\r\nultraviolet illumination.44−46 In addition, the Vopen can remain\r\nfor at least 5 min without decay under continuous light\r\nirradiation (Figure 3b), and such a steady power supply could\r\nbe controlled by switching the incident light on or off (Figure\r\n3c). Furthermore, temperature-variable Vopen and Ishort were\r\ncharacterized to explore the origin of the photovoltaic effect.\r\nAs shown in Figure 3d, 1 displays obvious Vopen (∼0.5 V) in\r\nthe ferroelectric phase. However, the Vopen gradually decreases\r\nwith increasing temperature and completely disappears in the\r\nFigure 3. (a) I−V curves under different illuminations.

Attributed to the superb photocatalytic\nactivity, photothermal and photoelectric effect of Tp-DBD, and the\nultra-high affinity to uranium, the Tp-DBD showed an exceedingly\nrapid equilibrium time of 8 days. To the best of our knowledge,\nTp-DBD exhibited the fastest saturation speed and extremely\nhigh uranium recovery capacity (10.31 mg g−1\n) compared with\nother porous framework adsorbents used for uranium recovery\nfrom natural seawater (Table S6, Supporting Information). Attrib-\nuted to the high affinity and selectivity of Tp-DBD to uranium,\nthe Tp-DBD only exhibited few adsorptions to other metal ions\nand showed 19.2× higher recovery capacity to uranium than to\nvanadium (Figure 8f). In particular, the selectivity of Tp-DBD\nto uranium is much higher than that of amidoxime-based\nadsorbents.[6b] Furthermore, the fluorescence experiment of the\nmodel compound further intuitively reflected that our designed\nuranium binding sites showed extremely high selectivity only to\nuranyl (Figures S71–S74, Supporting Information)",

Among them, LiFePO4 batteries have apparent advantages in the new energy industry due to their abundant raw materials, low price, and safety. 7–9 According to the 2023 white paper published by EV Tank & China YiWei Institute of Economics, in 2022, the total shipment of lithium-ion battery cathode materials in China was 1.447 million tons, of which LiFePO4 materials accounted for 58.65% of the overall market share (Fig. 1b). In recent years, more and more new energy vehicle companies have increased the demand for LiFePO4 batteries, and battery makers are also expanding the layout of LiFePO4 production capacity, which means that the market position of LiFePO 4 batteries will be more stable. With increasing possession of LiFePO4 batteries, treating numerous scrap cells is a pressing issue. 10–12 On the one hand, if spent LiFePO4 (SLFP) batteries are discarded directly without treatment, they will likely react in the environment and lead to serious pollution problems.13–15 On the other hand, LiFePO4 cathode material is rich in metal resources, including a lithium element content of around 1%, which exceeds that of ordinary natural lithium ore, with a high recycling value.16–18 Therefore, the recycling of SLFP batteries has long-term significance from the perspective of environmental protection and resource recycling",

The feeding molar ratio of Co/Fe is set to 2 in this case and can be easily adjusted to achieve a diﬀerent Co/ Fe ratio in the ﬁnal products to optimize the catalyst performance.

After the pyrolysis at 800 °C, the well-dispersed metallic Co 2 Fe 1 alloy nanoparticles encased in N-doped carbon (Co 2Fe 1@NC) are achieved via reducing metastable rock salt Co2Fe 1 oxide intermediates (RS CoFeO) generated in situ from the metal hydroxides. The PDA layer is simultaneously carbonized into a porous carbon network, anchoring these Co2Fe 1 @NC nanoparticles onto a graphene support.

When BTZ, CBZ, MPL, DCF and MCPP were present as individual compounds, similar dry weight at day 8 (1.6 ± 0.1 g/l, Fig. 2b) and speciﬁc growth rate (1.0 ± 0.1 d−1 , Table S3) were achieved. This shows that BTZ, CBZ, MPL, DCF and MCPP did not signiﬁcantly affect microalgal growth. In the presence of CLA, a lower dry weight and chlorophyll a was observed with S. obliquus at day 8 (Fig. 2), indicating that the growth of S. obliquus was inhibited by CLA. In comparison, S. obliquus was less tolerant to CLA than S. quadriculata, C. vulgaris and R. subcapitata (Guo et al., 2020; Kiki et al., 2020). So far, the inhibition processes of CLA on microalgal growth are unclear. It has however been described that CLA can inhibit the growth of bacteria by adversely affecting the synthesis of polypeptides and the translocation of aminoacyl transfer RNA (Guo et al., 2020). During this process, CLA can inhibit the activity of enzymes such as P450, which is involved in the biodegradation of OMPs (Akiyoshi et al., 2013; Masubuchi and Horie, 2007). A similar process might occur in S. obliquus, since microalgae have similar OMP degradation pathway as bacteria (Méndez García and García de Llasera, 2021). The dry weight at day 8 and speciﬁc growth rate in the presence of the OMP mixture were similar with control E (no OMPs) (Fig. 2, Table S3). This shows that the OMP mixture, including CLA, did not inhibit microalgal growth. Furthermore, the OMP mixture had an antagonistic effect on the CLA-induced inhibition on microalgal growth. Sharma et al. (2021) showed that OMPs compete for the binding sites of cells responsible for growth inhibition. Possibly such a mechanism explains the effect of CLA on microalgal growth.",

                "value": "hree out of six compounds (DCF, CLA and BTZ) were 48 to 99% removed in the microalgae cultivation spiked with OMPs exposed to light (treatment A) (Fig. 3). In contrast, CBZ, MPL and MCPP showed negligible removal (Fig. S2). Only a small amount (<5%) of these three compounds was bioadsorbed or bioaccumulated by the microalgal biomass (Table S5). DCF was only removed in the presence of light, with no signiﬁcant difference in the presence or absence of microalgae (Fig. 3a, b), indicating that photodegradation was the dominating removal process. An insigniﬁcant increase of DCF concentration was observed in control B (Algae + dark) and D (Dark) due to minor errors in the LC measurements. In treatment A (Algae + light), 99% of DCF was removed by photodegradation when present as individual compound, and 94% was photodegraded when present in the OMP mixture (Fig. 4). It is known that DCF is a light sensitive compound in many aqueous media (He et al., 2016; Kanakaraju et al., 2016) due to the photosensitive nature of its chlorinated aromatic ring (Moore et al., 1990), and has shown different photodegradation efﬁciencies under varying environmental conditions, such as light intensity and growth medium composition (de Wilt et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2020). Previous work showed that 40 to 60% of DCF was removed by photodegradation in anaerobically digested black water (AnBW) in one month (de Wilt et al., 2016). Compared to our experiments, less continuous irradiation was used (80 μmol m−2 s−1 instead of 126 μmol m−2 s−1 ), indicating that irradiation optimization results in a high removal of individual light sensitive OMPs. DCF biodegradation was not observed in our experiments (Fig. 3a, b), which is in line with previous results (de Wilt et al., 2016). However, this contrasts other studies, reporting Picocystis sp. and Graesiella sp. to biodegrade 20 to 70% of DCF when present in high concentrations of 25 to 200 mg/l (Ben Ouada et al., 2019). Possibly, a concentration above the mg/l range is needed to stimulate the DCF biodegradation. Bioadsorption and bioaccumulation of DCF were negligible (<1.2%). Likewise, another green microalgal species (Chlorella sp.) showed 5.5 to 7.5% of sorption (Bioadsorption and bioaccumulation) of DCF when adding 147 μg/l of DCF in urine and AnBW (de Wilt et al., 2016). CLA removal showed similar patterns in treatment A (Algae + light) and control C (Light) during the ﬁrst four days (Fig. 3c, d). This indicates that photodegradation dominated the removal of CLA during the ﬁrst four days. Moreover, biodegradation, bioadsorption and bioaccumulation may contribute to an enhanced CLA removal in treatment A four days later (Fig. 3c, d). Photodegradation of CLA accounted for 48% removal",

As a result, energy storage devices emerge to add buffer capacity and to reinforce residential and commercial usage, as an attempt to improve the overall utilization of the available green energy. Although various research has been conducted in the field including photovoltaic and wind applications, the study on suitability identification of different storage devices for various stationary application types is still the gap observed which needs further study and verification. The review performed fills these gaps by investigating the current status and applicability of energy storage devices, and the most suitable type of storage technologies for grid support applications are identified. Moreover, various technical, economic and environmental impact evaluation criteria’s are taken into consideration for the identification of their characteristics and potentials. The comprehensive review shows that, from the electrochemical storage category, the lithium-ion battery fits both low and medium-size applications with high power and energy density requirements. From the electrical storage categories, capacitors, supercapacitors, and superconductive magnetic energy storage devices are identified as appropriate for high power applications. Besides, thermal energy storage is identified as suitable in seasonal and bulk energy application areas. With proper identification of the application’s requirement and based on the techno-economic, and environmental impact investigations of energy storage devices, the use of a hybrid solutions with a combination of various storage devices is found to be a viable solution in the sector",

In this study, a mixed CuMn-HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared via an impregnation method. The optimized sample exhibited excellent performance with 90% NO conversion and 100% CO conversion at 175 ◦C. The activity window of the catalyst was coincident with the actual demand of sintering flue gas control at 150-250℃. The active component CuMn suppressed the excessive Lewis acid sites on the zeolite support for NH 3 adsorption, while the reducibility of the catalyst also decreased compared with that of pure CuMn metal oxides. This synergistic effect was beneficial for the reduction of NH3 nonselective oxidation with O2 . In addition, both the DFT and DRIFTS results revealed that NO conversion was improved by CO introduction at low temperature, since NO could adsorb on the CO-preadsorbed sites for the reduction to N2 via the O atoms of Mn3c sites, i.e., adsorbed CO could also serve as a reductant to reduce NO to N2 , which provides another reaction pathway in SCR reactions. Moreover, the NO 2 ? and N2O 2 ? species were observed in the spectra as key intermediates to oxidize CO to CO 2, which are also the promoters for CO control",
